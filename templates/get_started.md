# Get started with Lean

For users wishing to get started quickly and easily, the [quickstart guide](https://lean-lang.org/lean4/doc/quickstart.html) should walk you through the installation procedure if using the Visual Studio Code editor is acceptable.
After following the quickstart guide to install Lean, you can create a project that makes use of Mathlib (using VS Code) by clicking the `âˆ€` menu button in the top right corner, selecting `New Project` and then selecting `Project: Create Project Using Mathlib`.

If you only want to try Lean without installing it, you can try running it in
the cloud using Gitpod or GitHub codespaces. For instance you can read
the book [Mathematics in Lean](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathematics_in_lean/) while doing the exercises [on Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/#/https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathematics_in_lean). Note this Gitpod option requires you to create an account somewhere.

If you prefer to use a different editor the other options are emacs and neovim, although VS Code still has the best support.
For emacs, look at https://github.com/leanprover/lean4-mode. 
For neovim, look at https://github.com/Julian/lean.nvim)
Note: using an editor which has integration with Lean is absolutely crucial to the user experience.

For more experienced users who would like a bit more control over, and information about, what they are installing, please see these more detailed guides:

* [Debian/Ubuntu](install/debian_details.html)
* [Other linux](install/linux.html)
* [MacOS](install/macos_details.html)
* [Windows](install/windows.html)

After this installation procedure, it is crucial to read how to start or
get a [Lean project](install/project.html). And of course you'll
probably want to [learn Lean](learn.html)!
