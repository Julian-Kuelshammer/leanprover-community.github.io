# Translating Lean theorem statements to natural language 

In August 2022, we added natural language translations of theorem statements to the docs.
These statements are generated using OpenAI's GPT-3 language model.
The model gets a theorem name and statement as input, and is asked to produce a natural language equivalent.

These translations are generated with no human oversight.
**We expect many of them to be incorrect in various ways.**
You should not trust any particular translation without confirming it yourself!

## You can help!

As a browser of the API docs, you can help by flagging translations that look incorrect. 
A simple "yes" or "no" is useful.
Even better, if you can write a better translation, we can use this to improve the model. 
Don't worry about getting every last detail correct.
