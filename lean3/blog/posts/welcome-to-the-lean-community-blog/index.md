type: text
---
This is our brand new blog where you'll be able to find news about what is
happening in the Lean prover community. It will feature:

* posts highlighting some new contributions to mathlib
* news about ongoing projects such as the Liquid tensor experiment or the sphere eversion project
* news about exciting developments in other proofs assistants
* announcements of conferences and talks 
* some explanations of specific topics in a less formal context than the documentations
* speculations about future developments or somewhat philosophical discussions

There is no predefined list of authors. Everybody can submit a pull-request
with a post. If you are unsure whether your post will be welcome then don't
hesitate to first discuss the topic of your post on Zulip before investing too
much time writing it.
