    The admin team oversees the activities of the Lean community organization and in particular the mathlib project. It is responsible for ensuring the mathlib project continues to reflect the general views and interests of the Lean/mathlib community.

    The admin team is a central hub for coordination among other teams. It is responsible for procedural duties: when a decision needs to be made, what should the process be? How should votes be taken, if it's a voting matter?
    In particular it is responsible for resolving disagreements among teams by finding a way to reach consensus. The admin team is tasked with finding procedures to resolve conflicts when consensus cannot be reached.

    The admin team is the "first point of contact" for the community as a whole. This does not mean that they are in charge of all communication, but rather, can forward messages as needed, put the right people in touch, etc.

    Admin maintainers have the admin privileges for the GitHub organization, and they are the "default" keyholders and actors for things that are not the responsibility of other teams.

    The members of all teams choose an admin team annually by an election, in a manner organized by the current admin team using a system that gives all members a vote of equal weight. Members of the admin team may be re-elected any number of times with no limit.

    The mathlib maintainers are given the right to merge pull requests. 

    Mathlib maintainers usually have research-level knowledge in some field of mathematics or computer science, and they are given the responsibility to ensure mathlib has a cohesive design with a high-quality implementation. One should think of mathlib maintainers as being akin to journal editors.

    Community members become maintainers at the invitation of the current maintainers, and anyone may nominate a community member by sending a message to a current maintainer. Maintainers serve for a renewable two year term, with the expectation that the term will be renewed unless the maintainer has become inactive or wishes to step down.
