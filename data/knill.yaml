    A number $p \in \mathbb{N}, p>1$ is **prime** if $p$ has no factors
    different from $1$ and $p$. With a **prime factorization**
    $n=p_1 \dots p_n$, we understand the prime factors $p_j$ of $n$ to be
    ordered as $p_i \leq p_{i+1}$. The **fundamental theorem of arithmetic**
    is
    
    > Every $n \in \mathbb{N}, n>1$ has a unique prime factorization.
    
    Euclid anticipated the result. Carl Friedrich Gauss gave in 1798 the
    first proof in his monograph \"Disquisitiones Arithmeticae\". Within
    abstract algebra, the result is the statement that the ring of integers
    $\mathbb{Z}$ is a **unique factorization domain**. For a literature

    $A \in \mathcal{A}$. **Ergodic** means that that $T(A)=A$ implies

    This theorem from 1931 is due to George Birkhoff and called **Birkhoff's
    pointwise ergodic theorem**. It assures that \"time averages\" are equal
    to \"space averages\". A draft of the **von Neumann mean ergodic

    A **bijection** is a map from $X$ to $Y$ which is **injective**:

    there exists $x \in X$ with $f(x)=y$. Two sets $X,Y$ have the **same
    cardinality**, if there exists a bijection from $X$ to $Y$. Given a set
    $X$, the **power set** $2^X$ is the set of all subsets of $X$, including
    the **empty set** and $X$ itself. If $X$ has $n$ elements, the power set
    has $2^n$ elements. Cantor's theorem is
    
    > For any set $X$, the sets $X$ and $2^X$ have different cardinality.
    
    The result is due to Cantor. Taking for $X$ the natural numbers, then
    every $Y \in 2^X$ defines a real number
    $\phi(Y)=\sum_{y \in Y} 2^{-y} \in [0,1]$. As $Y$ and $[0,1]$ have the
    same cardinality (as **double counting pair cases** like
    $0.39999999 \dots = 0.400000 \dots$ form a countable set), the set
    $[0,1]$ is uncountable. There are different types of infinities leading
    to **countable infinite sets** and **uncountable infinite sets**. For
    comparing sets, the **Schröder-Bernstein** theorem is important. If
    there exist injective functions $f:X \to Y$ and $g: Y \to X$, then there
    exists a bijection $X \to Y$. This result was used by Cantor already.

    A **probability space** $(\Omega,\mathcal{A},{\rm P})$ consists of a set

    $\Omega$ which contains the empty set and which is closed under the
    operations of taking complements, countable unions and countable
    intersections. The function ${\rm P}$ on $\mathcal{A}$ takes values in
    the interval $[0,1]$, satisfies ${\rm P}[\Omega]=1$ and
    ${\rm P}[ \bigcup_{A \in S} A ] = \sum_{A \in S} {\rm P}[A]$ for any
    finite or countable set $S \subset \mathcal{A}$ of pairwise disjoint
    sets. The elements in $\mathcal{A}$ are called **events**. Given two
    events $A,B$ where $B$ satisfies ${\rm P}[B]>0$, one can define the
    **conditional probability** ${\rm P}[A|B]={\rm P}[A \cap B]/{\rm P}[B]$.
    Bayes theorem states:
    
    > ${\rm P}[A|B] = {\rm P}[B|A] {\rm P}[A]/{\rm P}[B]$
    
    The setup stated the **Kolmogorov axioms** by Andrey Kolmogorov who
    wrote in 1933 the \"Grundbegriffe der Wahrscheinlichkeitsrechnung\"
    [@Kolmogorov] based on measure theory built by Emile Borel and Henry
    Lebesgue. For history, see [@ShaferVovk], who report that \"Kolmogorov
    sat down to write the Grundbegriffe, in a rented cottage on the Klyaz'ma
    River in November 1932\". Bayes theorem is more like a fantastically
    clever definition and not really a theorem. There is nothing to prove as
    multiplying with ${\rm P}[B]$ gives ${\rm P}[A \cap B]$ on both sides.
    It essentially restates that $A \cap B = B \cap A$, the Abelian property
    of the product in the ring $\mathcal{A}$. More general is the statement
    that if $A_1, \dots, A_n$ is a disjoint set of events whose union is
    $\Omega$, then
    ${\rm P}[A_i|B] = {\rm P}[B|A_i] {\rm P}[A_i]/(\sum_j {\rm P}[B|A_j] {\rm P}[A_j]$.
    Bayes theorem was first proven in 1763 by Thomas Bayes. It is by some
    considered to the theory of probability what the Pythagoras theorem is
    to geometry. If one measures the ratio applicability over the difficulty
    of proof, then this theorem even beats Pythagoras, as no proof is
    required. Similarly as \"a+(b+c)=(a+b)+c\", also Bayes theorem is

    A **finite simple graph** $G=(V,E)$ is a finite collection $V$ of

    **self-loops** nor **multiple connections** are present in the graph.
    The **vertex degree** $d(x)$ of $x \in V$ is the number of edges
    containing $x$.
    
    > $\sum_{x \in V} d(x)/2 = |E|$.
    
    This formula is also called the **Euler handshake formula** because
    every edge in a graph contributes exactly two handshakes. It can be seen
    as a **Gauss-Bonnet formula** for the **valuation** $G \to v_1(G)$
    counting the number of edges in $G$. A **valuation** $\phi$ is a
    function defined on **subgraphs** with the property that
    $\phi(A \cup B) = \phi(A) + \phi(B) - \phi(A \cap B)$. Examples of
    valuations are the number $v_k(G)$ of **complete sub-graphs** of
    dimension $k$ of $G$. An other example is the **Euler characteristic**
    $\chi(G)=v_0(G)-v_1(G)+v_2(G)-v_3(G)+ \cdots + (-1)^d v_d(G)$. If we
    write $d_k(x)=v_k(S(x))$, where $S(x)$ is the unit sphere of $x$, then
    $\sum_{x \in V} d_k(x)/(k+1) = v_k(G)$ is the **generalized handshake
    formula**, the Gauss-Bonnet result for $v_k$. The Euler characteristic
    then satisfies $\sum_{x \in V} K(x) = \chi(G)$, where
    $K(x) = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} (-1)^k v_k(S(x))/(k+1)$. This is the

    Convex Polytopes were studied already in ancient Greece. The Euler
    characteristic relations were discovered in dimension $2$ by Descartes
    [@Aczel] and interpreted topologically by Euler who proved the case
    $d=2$. This is written as $v-e+f=2$, where $v=v_0,e=v_1,f=v_2$. The two
    dimensional case can be stated for **planar graphs**, where one has a
    clear notion of what the two dimensional cells are and can use the
    topology of the ambient sphere in which the graph is embedded.
    Historically there had been confusions [@cromwell; @Richeson] about the

    consensus on a general definition [@Gruenbaum2003], which was the reason
    in this entry to formula Schläfli's theorem using here a maybe a bit
    restrictive (as all cells are simplices), but clear combinatorial

    The result is used in the **Diffie-Helleman key exchange**, where a

    chooses a number $x$ and publishes $X=a^x {\rm mod} p$ and Bob picks $y$

    adversary Eve who only knows $a,p, X$ and $Y$ can from this not get $K$

    $\phi(n)$ counts the number of positive integers less than $n$ which are

    > If $|X|>|Y|$ then no function $X \to Y$ can be injective.
    
    This implies that if we place $n$ items into $m$ boxes and $n>m$, then
    one box must contain more than one item. The principle is believed to be
    formalized first by Peter Dirichlet. Despite its simplicity, the
    principle has many applications, like proving that something exists. An
    example is the statement that there are two trees in New York City
    streets which have the same number of leaves. The reason is that the
    U.S. Forest services states 592'130 trees in the year 2006 and that a
    mature, healthy tree has about 200'000 leaves. One can also use it for
    less trivial statements like that in a cocktail party there are at least
    two with the same number of friends present at the party. A mathematical
    application is the **Chinese remainder Theorem** stating that that there
    exists a solution to $a_i x = b_i \; {\rm mod} \; m_i$ all disjoint
    pairs $m_i, m_j$ and all pairs $a_i,m_i$ are relatively prime
    [@DingPeiSalomaa; @Martzloff]. The principle generalizes to infinite set
    if $|X|$ is the cardinality. It implies then for example that there is
    no injective function from the real numbers to the integers. For
    literature, see for example [@Brualdi2004], which states also a stronger
    version which for example allows to show that any sequence of real
    $n^2+1$ real numbers contains either an increasing subsequence of length
    $n+1$ or a decreasing subsequence of length $n+1$.

    Assume $f$ is an **analytic function** in an **open domain** $G$ of the

    **holomorphic** in $G$. Holomorphic means that if

    differential equations $u_x = v_y, u_y = -v_x$ hold in $G$. Assume $z$

    This **Cauchy integral formula** of Cauchy is used for other results and
    estimates. It implies for example the **Cauchy integral theorem**
    assuring that $\int_C f(z) dz=0$ for any simple closed curve $C$ in $G$
    bounding a simply connected region $D \subset G$. **Morera's theorem**
    assures that for any domain $G$, if $\int_C f(z) \; dz=0$ for all simple
    closed smooth curves $C$ in $G$, then $f$ is holomorphic in $G$. An
    other generalization is **residue calculus**: For a simply connected
    region $G$ and a function $f$ which is analytic except in a finite set
    $A$ of points. If $C$ is piecewise smooth continuous closed curve not
    intersecting $A$, then
    $\int_C f(z) \; dz = 2\pi i \sum_{a \in A} I(C,a) {\rm Res}(f,a)$, where
    $I(C,a)$ is the **winding number** of $C$ with respect to $a$ and

    every measurable set $A \subset G$. A left-invariant measure on $G$ is
    also called a **Haar measure**. A topological space is called **locally
    compact**, if every point has a compact neighborhood.
    
    > A locally compact group has a unique Haar measure.
    
    Alfréd Haar showed the existence in 1933 and John von Neumann proved
    that it is unique. In the compact case, the measure is finite, leading
    to an inner product and so to **unitary representations**. Locally
    compact **Abelian** groups $G$ can be understood by their
    **characters**, continuous group homomorphisms from $G$ to the circle
    group $\mathbb{T}=\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}$. The set of characters defines
    a new locally compact group $\hat{G}$, the **dual** of $G$. The
    multiplication is the pointwise multiplication, the inverse is the
    complex conjugate and the topology is the one of **uniform convergence**
    on compact sets. If $G$ is compact, then $\hat{G}$ is discrete, and if
    $G$ is discrete, then $\hat{G}$ is compact. In order to prove
    **Pontryagin duality** $\hat\hat{G}=G$, one needs a generalized
    **Fourier transform**
    $\hat{f}(\chi) = \int_G f(x) \overline{\chi(x)} d\mu(x)$ which uses the
    Haar measure. The **inverse Fourier transform** gives back $f$ using the
    **dual Haar measure**. The Haar measure is also used to define the
    **convolution** $f \star g(x) = \int_G f(x-y) g(y) d\mu(y)$ rendering
    $L^1(G)$ a **Banach algebra**. The Fourier transform then produces a
    homomorphism from $L^1(G)$ to $C_0(\hat{G})$ or a unitary transformation

    and still get continuous function. Assume $f(x,y)$ is a **smooth
    function** of two Euclidean variables $x,y \in \mathbb{R}^n$. If
    $f(a,0)=0$, we say $a$ is a **root** of $x \to f(x,y)$. If $f_y(x_0,y)$
    is invertible, the root is called **non-degenerate**. If there is a
    solution $f(g(y),y)=0$ such that $g(0)=a$ and $g$ is continuous, the
    root $a$ has a **local continuation** and say that it **persists** under
    perturbation.
    
    > A non-degenerate root persists under perturbation.
    
    This is the **implicit function theorem**. There are concrete and fast
    algorithms to compute the continuation. An example is the **Newton
    method** which iterates $T(x) = x -  f(x,y)/f_x(x,y)$ to find the roots
    of $x \to f(x,y)$ for fixed $y$. The importance of the implicit function
    theorem is both theoretical as well as applied. The result assures that
    one can makes statements about a complicated theory near some model,
    which is understood. There are related situations, like if we want to
    continue a solution of $F(x,y) = (f(x,y),g(x,y))=(0,0)$ giving
    **equilibrium points** of the **vector field** $F$. Then the Newton step
    $T(x,y) = (x,y) - dF^{-1}(x,y) \cdot F(x,y)$ method allows a
    continuation if $dF(x,y)$ is invertible. This means that small
    deformations of $F$ do not lead to changes of the nature of the
    equilibrium points. When equilibrium points change, the system exhibits
    **bifurcations**. This in particular applies to
    $F(x,y) = \nabla f(x,y)$, where equilibrium points are **critical
    points**. The derivative $dF$ of $F$ is then the **Hessian**.

    A **simplicial complex** $X$ is a finite set of non-empty sets that is

    For **zero-dimensional simplicial complexes** $G$, (meaning that all

    you have $m$ ways to do one thing and $n$ ways to do an other, then
    there are $m n$ ways to do both. This **fundamental counting principle**
    is used in probability theory for example. The **Cartesian product**
    $X \times Y$ of two complexes is defined as the set-theoretical product
    of the two finite sets. It is not a simplicial complex any more in
    general but has the same Euler characteristic than its Barycentric
    refinement $(X \times Y)_1$, which is a simplicial complex. The maximal
    dimension of $A \times B$ is ${\rm dim}(A) + {\rm dim}(B)$ and
    $p_X(t) = \sum_{k=0}^n v_k(X) t^k$ is the generating function of
    $v_k(X)$, then $p_{X \times Y}(t) = p_X(t) p_Y(t)$ implying the counting
    principle as $p_X(-1) = \chi(X)$. The function $p_X(t)$ is called the
    **Euler polynomial** of $X$. The importance of Euler characteristic as a
    **counting tool** lies in the fact that only $\chi(X)=p_X(-1)$ is
    invariant under **Barycentric subdivision** $\chi(X)=X_1$, where $X_1$
    is the complex which consists of the vertices of all complete subgraphs
    of the graph in which the sets of $X$ are the vertices and where two are

    Mathematicians had a long and painful struggle with the concept of

    around 450 BC. Archimedes of Syracuse made some progress around 250 BC.
    Since Augustin-Louis Cauchy, one defines the **limit**
    $\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = b$ **to exist** if and only if for all
    $\epsilon>0$, there exists a $\delta>0$ such that if $|x-a|<\delta$,
    then $|f(x)-b|<\epsilon$. A place where limits appear are when computing
    **derivatives** $g'(0) = \lim_{x \to 0} [g(x)-g(0)]/x$. In the case
    $g(x)=\sin(x)$, one has to understand the limit of the function
    $f(x)=\sin(x)/x$ which is the **sinc** function. A prototype result is
    the **fundamental theorem of trigonometry** (called as such in some
    calculus texts like [@Bretscher2006]).
    
    > $\lim_{x \to 0} \sin(x)/x = 1$.
    
    It appears strange to give weight to such a special result but it
    explains the difficulty of limit and the **l'Hôpital rule** of 1694,
    which was formulated in a book of Bernoulli commissioned to Hôpital: the
    limit can be obtained by differentiating both the denominator and
    nominator and taking the limit of the quotients. The result allows to
    derive (using trigonometric identities) that in general
    $\sin'(x)=\cos(x)$ and $\cos'(x)=-\sin(x)$. One single limit is the

    The **natural logarithm** is the inverse of the **exponential function**
    $\exp(x)$ establishing so a **group homomorphism** from the additive
    group $(\mathbb{R},+)$ to the multiplicative group $(\mathbb{R}^+,*)$.
    We have:
    
    > $\log(u v) = \log(u) + \log(v)$.
    
    This follows from $\exp(x+y) = \exp(x) \exp(y)$ and
    $\log(\exp(x))=\exp(\log(x))=x$ by plugging in $x=\log(u), y = \log(v)$.
    The logarithms were independently discovered by Jost Bürgi around 1600
    and John Napier in 1614 [@StaudacherBuergi]. The **logarithm** with base
    $b>0$ is denoted by $\log_b$. It is the inverse of
    $x \to b^x = e^{x \log(b)}$. The concept of logarithm has been extended
    in various ways: in any **group** $G$, one can define the **discrete
    logarithm** $\log_b(a)$ to base $b$ as an **integer** $k$ such that
    $b^k = a$ (if it exists). For complex numbers the **complex logarithm**
    $\log(z)$ as any solution $w$ of $e^w = z$. It is **multi-valued** as
    $\log(|z|) + i {\rm arg}(z) + 2\pi i k$ all solve this with some integer
    $k$, where ${\rm arg}(z) \in (-\pi,\pi)$. The identity
    $\log(u v) = \log(u) + \log(v)$ is now only true up to $2\pi k i$.
    Logarithms can also be defined for matrices. Any matrix $B$ solving
    $\exp(B)=A$ is called a **logarithm** of $A$. For $A$ close to the
    identity $I$, can define
    $\log(A) = (A-I) - (A-I)^2/2 + (A-I)^3/3 - ...$, which is a **Mercator
    series**. For **normal invertible matrices**, one can define logarithms
    using the **functional calculus** by diagonalization. On a **Riemannian
    manifold** $M$, one also has an exponential map: it is a diffeomorphim
    from a small ball $B_r(0)$ in the **tangent space** $x \in M$ to $M$.
    The map $v \to \exp_x(v)$ is obtained by defining $\exp_x(0)=x$ and by
    taking for $v \neq 0$ a **geodesic** with initial direction $v/|v|$ and
    running it for time $|v|$. The logarithm $\log_x$ is now defined on a
    **geodesic ball** of radius $r$ and defines an element in the tangent
    space. In the case of a Lie group $M=G$, where the points are matrices,
    each tangent space is its **Lie algebra**.

    A **quasilinear partial differential equation** is a differential
    equation of the form
    $u_t(x,t)= F(x,t,u) \cdot \nabla_x u(x,t) + f(x,t,u)$ with analytic
    initial condition $u(x,0)=u_0(x)$ and an **analytic** **vector field**
    $F$. It defines a **quasi-linear Cauchy problem**.
    
    > A quasi-linear Cauchy problem has a unique analytic solution.
    
    This is the **Cauchy-Kovalevskaya theorem**. It was initiated by
    Augustin-Louis Cauchy in 1842 and proven in 1875 by Sophie Kowalevskaya.
    Analyticity is important, smoothness alone is not enough. If $F$ is
    analytic in each variable, one can look at equations like the Cauchy
    problem $u_t = F(t,x,u,u_x,u_{xx})$. Examples are partial differential
    equations like the heat equation $u_t=u_{xx}$ or the wave equation
    $u_{tt} = u_{xx}$. Given an initial condition $u(0,x) = u_0(x)$ one then
    deals with an ordinary differential equation in a function space. One
    can then try to approach the Cauchy-Kovalevskaya problem by
    Picard-Lindelöf. The problem is that the Lipschitz condition fails
    because the corresponding operators are unbounded. Even Cauchy-Peano
    (which does not ask for uniqueness) fails. And this even in an analytic
    setting. [@Mouhot] gives the example $u_t = u_{xx}$ with initial
    condition $u(0,x) = 1/(1+x^2)$ for which the entire series solving the
    problem has a zero radius of convergence in $x$ for any $t>0$. Texts
    like [@TaylorPDE; @Mouhot] give full versions of the Cauchy-Kovalevskaya
    theorem for real-analytic Cauchy initial data on a real analytic
    hypersurface satisfying a non-characteristic condition for the partial
    differential equation. For a shorter introduction to partial
    differential equations, see [@Arnold2004].

    The equilibrium is called a **Nash equilibrium**. It tells us what we

    everybody else is doing. John Forbes Nash used in 1950 the **Brouwer
    fixed point theorem** and later in 1951 the **Kakutani fixed point
    theorem** to prove it. The Brouwer fixed point theorem itself is
    generalized by the **Lefschetz fixed point theorem** which equates the
    super trace of the induced map on cohomology with the sum of the indices
    of the fixed points. About John Nash and some history of game theory,

    In the second case, the solution depends continuously on $g$. The
    alternative can be put more generally by stating that if $A$ is a
    **compact operator** on a Hilbert space and $\lambda$ is not an
    eigenvalue of $A$, then the **resolvent** $(A-\lambda)^{-1}$ is bounded.
    A bounded operator $A$ on a Hilbert space $H$ is called **compact** if

    It uses **Szemerédi's theorem** [@FurstenbergRecurrence] which shows
    that any set $A$ of positive upper density
    $\limsup_{n \to \infty} |A \cap \{ 1 \cdots n\}|/n$ has arbitrary long

    the **relative density**
    $\limsup_{n \to \infty} |A \cap \{1 \cdots n\}|/|P \cap \{ 1 \cdots n\}|$
    is positive has arbitrary long arithmetic progressions. For non-linear
    sequences of numbers the problems are wide open. The **Landau problem**

    The Jordan curve theorem is due to Camille Jordan. His proof [@Jordan]
    was objected at first [@Kline42] but rehabilitated in
    [@HalesJordanProof]. The theorem can be strengthened, a **theorem of
    Schoenflies** tells that each of the two regions is homeomorphic to the
    disk $\{ (x,y) \in \mathbb{R}^2 \; | \; x^2+y^2 <1 \}$. In the smooth
    case, it is even possible to extend the map to a diffeomorphism in the
    plane. In higher dimensions, one knows that an embedding of the $(d-1)$
    dimensional sphere in a $\mathbb{R}^d$ divides space into two regions.
    This is the **Jordan-Brouwer** separation theorem. It is no more true in
    general that the two parts are homeomorphic to
    $\{ x \in \mathbb{R}^d \; | \;|x| <1 \}$: a counter example is the
    **Alexander horned sphere** which is a topological $2$-sphere but where

    variables of degree $d \geq 1$ defines a **projective hypersurface**
    $f=0$. Given $n$ projective irreducible hypersurfaces $f_k=c_k$ of
    degree $d_k$ in a **projective space** $\mathbb{P}^n$ we can look at the
    solution set $\{ f = c \} = \{f_1=c_1, \cdots, f_k=c_k \}$ of a system
    of nonlinear equations. The **Bézout's bound** is $d=d_1 \cdots d_k$ the
    product of the degrees. **Bézout's theorem** allows to count the number
    of solutions of the system, where the number of solutions is counted
    with multiplicity.
    
    > The set $\{f=c\}$ is either infinite or has $d$ elements.
    
    Bézout's theorem was stated in the \"Principia\" of Newton in 1687 but
    proven fist in 1779 by Étienne Bézout. If the hypersurfaces are all
    **irreducible** and in \"general position\", then there are exactly $d$
    solutions and each has multiplicity $1$. This can be used also for
    affine surfaces. If $y^2-x^3-3 x - 5=0$ is an **elliptic curve** for
    example, then $y^2 z -x^3-3xz^2-5z^3=$ is a projective hypersurface, its
    **projective completion**. Bézout's theorem implies part the fundamental
    theorem of algebra as for $n=1$, when we have only one homogeneous
    equation we have $d$ roots to a polynomial of degree $d$. The theorem
    implies for example that the intersection of two **conic sections** have
    in general $2$ intersection points. The example $x^2-yz=0,x^2+z^2-yz=0$
    has only the solution $x=z=0,y=1$ but with multiplicity $2$. As

    for every $x$, there exists a unique $y=x^{-1}$ such that $x*y=y*x=1$.
    The **order** $n$ of the group is the number of elements in the group.
    An element $x \in G$ generates a **subgroup** formed by

    > $|C(x)|$ is a factor of $|G|$
    
    The origins of group theory go back to Joseph Louis Lagrange, Paulo
    Ruffini and Évariste Galois. The concept of abstract group appeared
    first in the work of Arthur Cayley. Given a subgroup $H$ of $G$, the
    **left cosets** of $H$ are the equivalence classes of the equivalence
    relation $x \sim y$ if there exists $z \in H$ with $x = z*y$. The
    equivalence classes $G/N$ partition $G$. The number $[G:N]$ of elements
    in $G/H$ is called the **index** of $H$ in $G$. It follows that
    $|G| = |H| [G:H]$ and more generally that if $K$ is a subgroup of $H$
    and $H$ is a subgroup of $G$ then $[G:K] = [G:H] [H:K]$. The group $N$
    generated by $x$ is a called a **normal group** $N \triangleleft G$ if
    for all $a \in N$ and all $x$ in $G$ the element $x * a * x^{-1}$ is in
    $N$. This can be rewritten as $H*x = x*H$. If $N$ is a normal group,
    then $G/H$ is again a group, the **quotient group**. For example, if
    $f: G \to G'$ is a group homomorphism, then the kernel of $f$ is a
    normal subgroup and $|G| = |{\rm ker}(f)| |{\rm im}(f)|$ because of the

    $n$ for which $(n-1)!+1$ is divisible by $n$. Euclid already knew that
    there are infinitely many primes (if there were finitely many
    $p_1, \dots, p_n$, the new number $p_1 p_2 \cdots p_n+1$ would have a
    prime factor different from the given set). It also follows from the
    **divergence** of the **harmonic series**
    $\zeta(1) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} 1/n = 1+1/2+1/3 + \cdots$ and the
    **Euler golden key** or **Euler product**
    $\zeta(s) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} 1/n^2 = \sum_{p \; {\rm prime}} (1-1/p^s)^{-1}$
    for the **Riemann zeta function** $\zeta(s)$ that there are infinitely
    many primes as otherwise, the product to the right would be finite.
    
    Let $\pi(x)$ be the **prime-counting function** which gives the number
    of primes smaller or equal to $x$. Given two functions $f(x),g(x)$ from
    the integers to the integers, we say $f \sim g$, if
    $\lim_{x \to \infty} f(x)/g(x)=1$. The **prime number theorem** tells

    The result was investigated experimentally first by Anton Ferkel and
    Jurij Vega, Adrien-Marie Legendre first conjectured in 1797 a law of
    this form. Carl Friedrich Gauss wrote in 1849 that he experimented
    independently around 1792 with such a law. The theorem was proven in
    1896 by Jacques Hadamard and Charles de la Vallée Poussin. Proofs
    without complex analysis were put forward by Atle Selberg and Paul Erdös
    in 1949. The prime number theorem also assures that there are infinitely
    many primes but it makes the statement **quantitative** in that it gives
    an idea how fast the number of primes grow asymptotically. Under the
    assumption of the Riemann hypothesis, Lowell Schoenfeld proved
    $|\pi(x)-{\rm li}(x)| < \sqrt{x} \log(x)/(8 \pi)$, where

    d-dimensional configurations. The topology is the product topology which
    is compact by the Tychonov theorem. The translation maps
    $T_i(x)_n=x_{n+e_i}$ are homeomorphisms of $\Omega$ called **shifts**. A
    closed $T$ invariant subset $X \subset \Omega$ defines a **subshift**
    $(X,T)$. An automorphism $T$ of $\Omega$ which commutes with the
    translations $T_i$ is called a **cellular automaton**, abbreviated $CA$.
    An example of a cellular automaton is a map
    $T x_n = \phi(x_{n+u_1}, \dots x_{n+u_k})$ where
    $U = \{ u_1, \dots u_k \} \subset \mathbb{Z}^d$ is a fixed finite set.
    It is called an **local automaton** because it is defined by a finite
    rule so that the status of the cell $n$ at the next step depends only on
    the status of the \"neighboring cells\" $\{ n+u  \; | \; u \in U \}$. The
    following result is the **Curtis-Hedlund-Lyndon theorem**:
    
    > Every cellular automaton is a local automaton.
    
    Cellular automata were introduced by John von Neumann and mathematically
    in 1969 by Hedlund [@Hed69]. The result appears there. Hedlund saw
    cellular automata also as maps on subshifts. One can so look at cellular
    automata on subclasses of subshifts. For example, one can restrict the
    cellular automata map $T$ on almost periodic configurations, which are
    subsets $X$ of $\Omega$ on which $(X,T_1,\dots T_j)$ has only invariant
    measures $\mu$ for which the Koopman operators $U_i f = f(T_i)$ on
    $L^2(X,\mu)$ have pure point spectrum. A particularly well studied case
    is $d=1$ and $A=\{0,1\}$, if $U=\{ -1,0,1\}$, where the automaton is
    called an **elementary cellular automaton**. The **Wolfram numbering**
    labels the $2^8$ possible elementary automata with a number between 1
    and 255. The **game of life** of Conway is a case for $d=2$ and
    $A=\{ -1,0,1\} \times \{-1,0,1 \}$. For literature on cellular automata

    A **category** has **objects** as **nodes** and **morphisms** as
    **arrows** going from one object to an other object. There can be
    multiple connections and self-loops so that one can visualize a category
    as a **quiver**. Every object has the identity arrow $1_A$. A **topos**
    $X$ is a **Cartesian closed** category $C$ in which **finite limits**
    exists and which has a **sub-object classifier** $\Omega$ allowing to
    identify sub-objects with morphisms from $X$ to $\Omega$. **Cartesian
    closed** means that one can define for any pair of objects $A,B$ in $C$
    the **product** $A \times B$ and an **equalizer** representing solutions
    $f=g$ to arrows $f:A \to B, G:A \to B$ as well as an **exponential**
    $B^A$ representing all arrows from $A$ to $B$. An example is the topos
    of sets. An example of a sub-object classifier is $\Omega=\{0,1\}$
    encoding \"true or false\".
    
    The **slice category** $E/X$ of a category $E$ with an object $X$ in $E$
    is a category, where the objects are the arrows from $E \to X$. An $E/X$
    arrow between objects $f: A \to X$ and $g: B \to X$ is a map
    $s: A \to B$ which produces a commutative triangle in $E$. The
    composition is pasting triangles together. The **fundamental theorem of
    topos theory** is:
    
    > The slice category $E/X$ of a topos $E$ is a topos.
    
    For example, if $E$ is the topos of sets, then the slice category is the
    category of **pointed sets**: the objects are then sets together with a
    function selecting a point as a \"base point\". A morphism $f:A \to B$
    defines a functor $E/B \to E/A$ which preserves exponentials and the
    **subobject classifier** $\Omega$. Topos theory was motivated by
    geometry (Grothendieck), physics (Lawvere), topology (Tierney) and
    algebra (Kan). It can be seen as a generalization and even a replacement
    of set theory: the Lawvere's **elementary theory of the category of
    sets** ETCS is seen as part of ZFC which are less likely to be
    inconsistent [@Leinster2012]. For a short introduction [@Illusie], for

    **transcendental numbers**. Transcendental numbers are necessarily
    irrational because every rational number $x=p/q$ is algebraic, solving
    $q x-p=0$. Because the set of algebraic numbers is countable and the
    real numbers are not, most numbers are transcendental. The group of all
    automorphisms of $A$ which fix $\mathbb{Q}$ is called the **absolute
    Galois group** of $\mathbb{Q}$.
    
    > $\pi$ and $e$ are transcendental
    
    This result is due to Ferdinand von Lindemann. He proved that $e^x$ is
    transcendental for every non-zero algebraic number $x$. This immediately
    implies $e$ is transcendental. Now, if $\pi$ were algebraic, then
    $\pi i$ would be algebraic and $e^{i \pi} = -1$ would be transcendental.
    But $-1$ is rational. Lindemann's result was extended in 1885 by Karl
    Weierstrass to the statement telling that if $x_1, \dots x_n$ are
    linearly independent algebraic numbers, then $e^{x_1}, \dots e^{x_n}$
    are algebraically independent. The transcendental property of $\pi$ also

    It is known even that the set of multiple recurrent points are Baire

    **multiple recurrent** if there exists $A \in \mathcal{A}$ and an

    ${\rm P}[ A \cap T_1(A) \cap \cdots \cap T_d(A)] >0$. This generalizes

    called **separable** if the associated irreducible polynomial $f$ is
    separable, meaning that $f'$ is not zero. This means, that $F$ has zero
    characteristic or that $f$ is not of the form $\sum_k a_k x^{p k}$ if
    $F$ has characteristic $p$. A field extension is called **Galois** if it
    normal and separable. Let ${\bf Fields}(E/F)$ be the set of subfields of
    $E/F$ and ${\bf Groups}(E/F))$ the set of subgroups of the automorphism
    group ${\rm Aut}(E/F)$. The **Fundamental theorem of Galois theory**
    assures:

    ${\bf Fields}(E/F) \overset{bijective}{\leftrightarrow} {\bf Groups}(E/F)$
    if $E/F$ is Galois.
    
    The **intermediate fields** of $E/F$ are so described by groups. It
    implies the **Abel-Ruffini theorem** about the non-solvability of the
    quintic by radicals. The fundamental theorem demonstrates that solvable
    extensions correspond to solvable groups. The **symmetry groups** of

    A **topological space** $(X,\mathcal{O})$ is given by a set $X$ and a
    finite collection $\mathcal{O}$ of subsets of $X$ with the property that
    the **empty set** $\emptyset$ and $\Omega$ both belong to $\mathcal{O}$
    and that $\mathcal{O}$ is closed under arbitrary unions and finite
    intersections. The sets in $\mathcal{O}$ are called **open sets**.
    **Metric spaces** $(X,d)$ are special topological spaces. In that case,
    $\mathcal{O}$ consists of all sets $U$ such that for every $x \in U$
    there exists $r>0$ such that the **open ball**
    $B_r(x) = \{ y \in X \; | \; d(x,y)<r \}$ is contained in $U$. Two
    topological spaces $(X,\mathcal{O})$, $(Y,\mathcal{Q})$ are
    **homeomorphic** if there exists a bijection $f:X \to Y$, such that $f$
    and $f^{-1}$ are both continuous. A function $f:X \to Y$ is
    **continuous** if $f^{-1}(A) \in \mathcal{O}$ for all $A \in Q$. When is
    a topological space homeomorphic to a metric space? The **Urysohn
    metrization theorem** gives an answer: we need the **regular Hausdorff
    property** meaning that a closed set $K$ and a point $x$ can be
    separated by disjoint neighborhoods $K \subset U, y \in V$. We also need
    the space to be **second countable** meaning that there is a countable
    base (a base in $\mathcal{O}$ is a subset
    $\mathcal{B} \subset \mathcal{O}$ such that every $U \in \mathcal{O}$
    can be written as a union of elements in $\mathcal{B}$.)
    
    > A second countable regular Hausdorff space is metrizable.
    
    The result was proven by Pavel Urysohn in 1925 with \"regular\" replaced
    by \"normal\" and by Andrey Tychonov in 1926. It follows that a compact
    Hausdorff space is metrizable if and only if it is second countable. For

    Given a continuous **transformation** $T:X \to X$ of a compact
    topological space $X$, one can look for the **fixed point** set
    ${\rm Fix}_T(X) = \{ x \; | \; T(x)=x \}$. This is useful for finding
    **periodic points** as fixed points of
    $T^n=T\circ T \circ T \cdots \circ T$ are periodic points of period $n$.
    If $X$ has a finite **cohomology** like if $X$ is a compact $d$-manifold
    with boundary, one can look at the **linear map** $T_p$ induced on the
    cohomology groups $H^p(X)$. The **super trace**
    $\chi_T(X)=\sum_{p=0}^d (-1)^p {\rm tr}(T_p)$ is called the **Lefschetz
    number** of $T$ on $X$. If $T$ is the identity, this is the **Euler
    characteristic**. Let ${\rm ind}_T(x)$ be the **Brouwer degree** of the
    map $T$ induced on a small $(d-1)$-sphere $S$ around $x$. This is the
    **trace** of the linear map $T_{d-1}$ induced from $T$ on the cohomology
    group $H^{d-1}(S)$ which is an integer. If $T$ is differentiable and
    $dT(x)$ is invertible, the Brouwer degree is
    ${\rm ind}_T(x) = {\rm sign}({\rm det}(dT))$. Let ${\rm Fix}_T(X)$
    denote the set of fixed points of $T$. The **Lefschetz-Hopf fixed point
    theorem** is
    
    > If ${\rm Fix}_T(X)$ is finite, then
    $\chi_T(X) = \sum_{x \in {\rm Fix}_T(X)} {\rm ind}_T(x)$.
    
    A special case is the **Brouwer fixed point theorem**: if $X$ is a
    compact convex subset of Euclidean space. In that case $\chi_T(X)=1$ and
    the theorem assures the existence of a fixed point. In particular, if
    $T: D \to D$ is a continuous map from the disc $D=\{ x^2+y^2 \leq 1 \}$
    onto itself, then $T$ has a fixed point. The **Brouwer fixed point
    theorem** was proved in 1910 by Jacques Hadamard and Luitzen Egbertus
    Jan Brouwer. The **Schauder fixed point theorem** from 1930 generalizes
    the result to convex compact subsets of Banach spaces. The
    Lefschetz-Hopf fixed point theorem was given in 1926. For literature,

    Given a prime $p$, a number $a$ is called a **quadratic residue** if
    there exists a number $x$ such that $x^2$ has remainder $a$ modulo $p$.
    In other words quadratic residues are the squares in the field
    $\mathbb{Z}_p$. The **Legendre symbol** $(a|p)$ is defined by be $0$ if
    $a$ is $0$ or a multiple of $p$ and $1$ if $a$ is a non-zero residue of
    $p$ and $-1$ if it is not. While the integer $0$ is sometimes considered
    to be a quadratic residue we don't include it as it is a special case.
    Also, in the multiplicative group $\mathbb{Z}_p^*$ without zero, there
    is a symmetry: there are the same number of quadratic residues and
    non-residues. This is made more precise in the **law of quadratic
    reciprocity**
    
    > For any two odd primes
    $(p|q) (q|p) = (-1)^{\frac{p-1}{2} \frac{q-1}{2}}$.
    
    This means that $(p|q) = -(q|p)$ if and only if both $p$ and $q$ have
    remainder $3$ modulo $4$. The odd primes with of the form $4k+3$ are
    also prime in the Gaussian integers. To remember the law, one can think
    of them as \"Fermions\" and quadratic reciprocity tells they Fermions are
    anti-commuting. The odd primes of the form $4k+1$ factor by the
    **4-square theorem** in the Gaussian plane to $p=(a+ib) (a-ib)$ and are
    as a product of two Gaussian primes and are therefore Bosons. One can
    remember the rule because Boson commute both other particles so that if
    either $p$ or $q$ or both are \"Bosonic\", then $(p|q)=(q|p)$. The law of
    quadratic reciprocity was first conjectured by Euler and Legendre and
    published by Carl Friedrich Gauss in his Disquisitiones Arithmeticae of
    1801. (Gauss found the first proof in 1796). [@HardyWright; @Hua1982].

    Mandelbrot first thought after seeing experiments that it was

    continuous functions, one can define a distance
    $d(f,g) = {\rm max}_{x \in I} |f(x)-g(x)|$. A subset $Y$ of $X$ is

    exists $y \in Y$ with $d(x,y)<\epsilon$. Let $P$ denote the class of
    **polynomials** in $X$. The **Weierstrass approximation theorem** tells
    that
    
    > Polynomials $P$ are dense in continuous functions $C(I)$.
    
    The Weierstrass theorem has been proven in 1885 by Karl Weierstrass. A
    constructive proof suggested by sergey Bernstein in 1912 uses
    **Bernstein polynomials** $f_n(x) = \sum_{k=0}^n f(k/n) B_{k,n}(x)$ with
    $B_{k,n}(x) = B(n,k) x^k (1-x)^{n-k}$, where $B(n,k)$ denote the
    Binomial coefficients. The result has been generalized to compact
    Hausdorff spaces $X$ and more general subalgebras of $C(X)$. The
    **Stone-Weierstrass approximation theorem** was proven by Marshall Stone
    in 1937 and simplified in 1948 by Stone. In the complex, there is
    **Runge's theorem** from 1885 approximating functions holmomorphic on a
    bounded region $G$ with rational functions uniformly on a compact subset
    $K$ of $G$ and **Mergelyan's theorem** from 1951 allowing approximation
    uniformly on a compact subset with polynomials if the region $G$ is
    simply connected. In **numerical analysis** one has the task to
    approximate a given function space by functions from a simpler class.

    **Thue-Siegel-Roth theorem** tells:

    The **Hurwitz's theorem** from 1891 assures that there are infinitely

    the Tue-Siegel-Roth Theorem can not be extended to $\epsilon=0$. The

    case $m=0$, where $f$ is only differentiable. The remainder term can
    also be written as $\int_a^x f^{(m+1)}(s) (x-a)^m/m! \; ds$. Taylor did

    If $B=B_1$, this gives $n |B| \leq |S|$, which is an equality as then
    the **volume of the ball** $|B|=\pi^{n/2}/\Gamma(n/2+1)$ and the

    the constraint $L=1$ together with a fix of $(x_0,y_0)$ and

    A Riemann surface is a one-dimensional complex manifold. It is a
    two-dimensional real analytic manifold but it has also a **complex
    structure** forcing it to be orientable for example. Let $G$ be a
    compact connected **Riemann surface** of Euler characteristic
    $\chi(G)=1-g$, where $g=b_1(G)$ is the **genus**, the number of handles
    of $G$ (and $1=b_0(G)$ indicates that we have only one connected
    component). A **divisor** $D=\sum_i a_i z_i$ on $G$ is an element of the
    free Abelian group on the points of the surface. These are finite formal
    sums of points $z_i$ in $G$, where $a_i \in \mathbb{Z}$ is the
    multiplicity of the point $z_i$. The **degree** of the divisor is
    defined as ${\rm deg}(D)=\sum_i a_i$. Let us write
    $\chi(X)={\rm deg}(D) + \chi(G)= {\rm deg}(D)+1-g$ and call this the
    **Euler characteristic** of the divisor $D$ as one can see a divisor as
    a geometric object by itself generalizing the complex manifold $X$
    (which is the case $D=0$). A **meromorphic function** $f$ on $G$ defines
    the **principal divisor** $(f)=\sum_i a_i z_i - \sum_j b_j w_j$, where
    $a_i$ are the multiplicities of the **roots** $z_i$ of $f$ and $b_j$ the
    multiplicities of the **poles** $w_j$ of $f$. The principal divisor of a
    global meromorphic 1-form $dz$ which is called the **canonical divisor**
    $K$. Let $l(D)$ be the dimension of the linear space of meromorphic
    functions $f$ on $G$ for which $(f) + D \geq 0$. (The notation $\geq 0$
    means that all coefficients are non-negative. One calls such a divisor
    **effective**). The **Riemann-Roch** theorem is
    
    > $l(D) - l(K-D) = \chi(D)$
    
    The idea of a Riemann surfaces was defined by Bernhard Riemann.
    Riemann-Roch was proven for Riemann surfaces by Bernhard Riemann in 1857
    and Gustav Roch in 1865. It is possible to see this as a
    **Euler-Poincaré type relation** by identifying the left hand side as a
    signed cohomological Euler characteristic and the right hand side as a
    combinatorial Euler characteristic. There are various generalizations,
    to arithmetic geometry or to higher dimensions. See

    Given two probability spaces $(X,P),(Y,Q)$ and a continuous **cost
    function** $c: X \times Y \to [0,\infty]$, the **optimal transport
    problem** or **Monge-Kantorovich minimization problem** is to find the
    minimum of $\int_X c(x,T(x)) \; dP(x)$ among all **coupling
    transformations** $T: X \to Y$ which have the property that it
    transports the measure $P$ to the measure $Q$. More generally, one looks
    at a measure $\pi$ on $X \times Y$ such that the projection of $\pi$
    onto $X$ it is $P$ and the projection of $\pi$ onto $Y$ is $Q$. The
    function to optimize is then
    $I(\pi) = \int_{X \times Y} c(x,y) \; d\pi(x,y)$. One of the fundamental
    results is that optimal transport exists. The technical assumption is
    that if the two probability spaces $X,Y$ are **Polish** (=separable
    complete metric spaces) and that the cost function $c$ is continuous.
    
    > For continuous cost functions $c$, there exists a minimum of $I$.
    
    In the simple set-up of probability spaces, this just follows from the
    compactness (Alaoglu theorem for balls in the weak star topology of a
    Banach space) of the set of probability measures: any sequence $\pi_n$
    of probability measures on $X \times Y$ has a convergent subsequence.
    Since $I$ is continuous, picking a sequence $\pi_n$ with $I(\pi_n)$
    decreasing produces to a minimum. The problem was formalized in 1781 by
    Gaspard Monge and worked on by Leonid Kantorovich. Hirisho Tanaka in the
    1970ies produced connections with partial differential equations like
    the Bolzmann equation. There are also connections to **weak KAM theory**
    in the form of Aubry-Mather theory. The above existence result is true
    under substantial less regularity. The question of uniqueness or the
    existence of a Monge coupling given in the form of a transformation $T$

    Given $m$ hyper planes in $\mathbf{R}^d$ serving as retinas or

    $\mathbf{R}^d$. The **affine structure from motion** problem is to
    understand under which conditions it is possible to recover both the
    points and planes when knowing the orthogonal projections onto the
    planes. It is a model problem for the task to reconstruct both the scene
    as well as the camera positions if the scene has $n$ points and $m$
    camera pictures were taken. Ullman's theorem is a prototype result with
    $n=3$ different cameras and $m=3$ points which are not collinear. Other
    setups are **perspective cameras** or **omni-directional cameras**. The
    **Ullman** map $F$ is a nonlinear map from $R^{d \cdot 2} \times SO_d^2$
    to $(R^{3d-3})^2$ which is a map between equal dimensional spaces if
    $d=2$ and $d=3$. The group $SO_d$ is the rotation group in
    $\mathbb{R^d}$ describing the possible ways in which the affine camera
    can be positioned. Affine cameras capture the same picture when
    translated so that the planes can all go through the origin. In the case
    $d=2$, we get a map from $R^4 \times SO_2^2$ to $R^6$ and in the case
    $d=3$, $F$ maps $\mathbf{R}^6 \times SO_3^2$ into $\mathbf{R}^{12}$.
    
    > The structure from motion map is locally invertible.
    
    In the case $d=2$, there is a reflection ambiguity. In dimension $d=3$,
    the number of ambiguities is typically $64$. Ullman's theorem appeared
    in 1979 in [@Ullman]. Ullman states the theorem for d=3 with 4 points as
    adding a four point cuts the number of ambiguities from 64 to 2. See
    [@KnillHerranB] both in dimension d=2 and d=3 the Jacobean $dF$ of the
    Ullman map is seen to be invertible and the inverse of $F$ is given
    explicitly. For structure from motion problems in computer vision in
    general, see [@faugeras96; @hartley; @Trucco]. In applications one takes
    $n$ and $m$ large and reconstructs both the points as well as the camera
    parameters using **statistical data fitting**.

    What functions $u$ solve the **Poisson equation** $-\Delta u = f$, a

    for $f \in L^1$ as
    $K_f(x) = \int_{{\mathbb R}^n} G(x,y) f(y) \; dy + h$, where $h$ is
    **harmonic**. If $f=0$, then the Poisson equation is the **Laplace
    equation**. The function $G(x,y)$ is the **Green's function**, an
    **integral kernel**. It satisfies $-\Delta G(x,y) = \delta(y-x)$, where
    $\delta$ is the **Dirac delta function**, a distribution. It is given by
    $G(x,y) = -\log|x-y|/(2\pi)$ for $n=2$ or $G(x,y) =|x-y|^{-1}/(4\pi)$
    for $n=3$. In **elliptic regularity theory**, one replaces the Laplacian
    $-\Delta$ with an **elliptic** second order **differential operator**
    $L=A(x) \cdot D \cdot D + b(x) \cdot D + V(x)$ where $D=\nabla$ is the
    gradient and $A$ is a positive definite matrix, $b(x)$ is a vector field
    and $c$ is a scalar field.
    
    > For $f \in L^p$ and $p>n$, then $K_f$ is differentiable.
    
    The result is much more general and can be extended. If $f$ is in $C^k$
    and has compact support for example, then $K_f$ is in $C^{k+1}$. An
    example of the more general set up is the **Schrödinger operator**
    $L=-\Delta + V(x)-E$. The solution to $L u = 0$, solves then an
    eigenvalue problem. As one looks for solutions in $L^2$, the solution
    only exists if $E$ is an **eigenvalue** of $L$. The Euclidean space
    $\mathbb{R}^n$ can be replaced by a bounded domain $\Omega$ of
    $\mathbb{R}^n$ where one can look at boundary conditions like of
    Dirichlet or von Neumann type. Or one can look at the situation on a
    general Riemannian manifold $M$ with or without boundary. On a Hilbert
    space, one has then **Fredholm theory**. The equation
    $u=\int G(x,y) f(y) dy$ is called a **Fredholm integral equation** and
    ${\rm det}(1 - s G) = \exp(-\sum_n s^n {\rm tr}(G^n)/n!)$ the **Fredholm

    Hilbert proved in 1909, that $g(k)$ is finite. This is the
    **Hilbert-Waring theorem**. The following **theorem of Lagrange** tells
    that $g(2)=4$:

    The result needs only to be verified for prime numbers as

    which has the property $N(p q) = N(p) N(q)$. This property can be seen
    also as a **Cauchy-Binet formula**, when writing quaternions as complex
    $2 \times 2$ matrices. The four-square theorem had been conjectured
    already by Diophantus, but was proven first by Lagrange in 1770. The

    characterizes the knot up to mirror reflection, the theory of knots is
    part of **3-manifold theory**. The **HOMFLYPT** polynomial $P$ of a knot

    $l P(L_+) + l^{-1} P(L^-) + m P(L_0) = 0$. Let $K \# L$ denote the

    is $f'=g,g'=\int_N \nabla V(f(x)-f(y)) \; dm(y)$. Starting with
    $X_0=Id$, we get a flow $X_t$ and by push forward an evolution
    $P^t=X_t^* m$ of probability measures on $N$. The Vlasov
    intro-differential equations on measures in $T^*N$ are
    $\dot{P}^t(x,y) + y \cdot \nabla_x P^t(x,y) - W(x) \cdot \nabla_y P^t(x,y) = 0$
    with $W(x)=\int_{M} \nabla_x V(x-x') P^t(x',y') ) \; dy' dx'$. Note that
    while $X_t$ is an infinite dimensional **ordinary differential
    equations** evolving maps $M \to T^*N$, the path $P^t$ is an **integro
    differential equation** describing the evolution of measures on $T^*N$.
    
    > If $X_t$ solves the Vlasov Hamiltonian, then $P^t=X_t^* m$ solves
    Vlasov.
    
    This is a result which goes back to James Clerk Maxwell. Vlasov dynamics
    was introduced in 1938 by Anatoly Vlasov. An existence result was proven
    by W. Brown and Klaus Hepp in 1977. The maps $X_t$ will stay perfectly
    smooth if smooth initially. However, even if $P^0$ is smooth, the
    measure $P^t$ in general rather quickly develops singularities so that
    the partial differential equation has only **weak solutions**. The
    analysis of $P$ directly would involve complicated function spaces. The
    **fundamental theorem of Vlasov dynamics** therefore plays the role of
    the **method of characteristics** in this field. If $M$ is a finite
    probability space, then the Vlasov Hamiltonian system is the
    **Hamiltonian $n$-body problem** on $N$. An other example is $M=T^*N$
    and where $m$ is an initial phase space measure. Now $X_t$ is a one
    parameter family of diffeomorphisms $X_t: M \to T^*N$ pushing forward
    $m$ to a measure $P^t$ on the cotangent bundle. If $M$ is a circle then
    $X^0$ defines a closed curve on $T^*N$. In particular, if $\gamma(t)$ is
    a curve in $N$ and $X^0(t) = (\gamma(t),0)$, we have a continuum of
    particles initially at rest which evolve by interacting with a force
    $\nabla V$. About interacting particle dynamics, see [@Spohn].

    A **hypercomplex algebra** is a finite dimensional algebra over

    hypercomplex algebras (up to isomorphism) of two-dimensional
    hypercomplex algebras over the reals are the **complex numbers** $x+iy$
    with $i^2=-1$, the **split complex numbers** $x+jy$ with $j^2=-1$ and
    the **dual numbers** (the exterior algebra) $x+\epsilon y$ with
    $\epsilon^2=0$. A **division algebra** over a field $F$ is an algebra
    over $F$ in which division is possible. **Wedderburn's little theorem**
    tells that a finite division algebra must be a finite field. Only
    $\mathbb{C}$ is the only two dimensional **division algebra** over
    $\mathbb{R}$. The following theorem of Frobenius classifies the class
    $\mathcal{X}$ of finite dimensional associative division algebras over
    $\mathbb{R}$:
    
    > $\mathcal{X}$ consists of the algebras $\mathbb{R},\mathbb{C}$ and
    $\mathbb{H}$.
    
    Hypercomplex numbers like **quaternions**, **tessarines** or
    **octonions** extend the algebra of complex numbers. Cataloging them
    started with Benjamin Peirce 1872 \"Linear associative algebra\". **Dual
    numbers** were introduced in 1873 by William Clifford. The
    **Cayley-Dickson constructions** generates iteratively algebras of twice
    the dimensions: like the complex numbers from the reals, the quaternions
    from the complex numbers or the octonions from the quaternions (for
    octonions associativity is lost). The next step leads to **sedenions**
    but the later are not even an alternative algebra any more. The Hurwitz
    and Frobenius theorems limit the number in the case of normed division
    algebras. Ferdinand George Frobenius classified in 1877 the
    finite-dimensional associative division algebras. Adolf Hurwitz proved
    in 1923 (posthumously) that unital finite dimensional real algebra
    endowed with a positive-definite quadratic form (a **normed division
    algebra** must be $\mathbb{R},\mathbb{C},\mathbb{H}$ or $\mathbb{O}$).
    These four are the only **Euclidean Hurwitz algebras**. In 1907, Joseph
    Wedderburn classified simple algebras (simple meaning that there are no
    non-trivial two-sided ideals and $ab=0$ implies $a=0$ or $b=0$). In 1958
    J. Frank Adams showed topologically that
    $\mathbb{R},\mathbb{C},\mathbb{H},\mathbb{O}$ are the only finite
    dimensional real division algebras. In general, division algebras have
    dimension $1,2,4$ or $8$ as Michel Kervaire and Raoul Bott and John
    Milnor have shown in 1958 by relating the problem to the
    **parallelizability of spheres**. The problem of classification of
    division algebras over a field $F$ led Richard Brauer to the **Brauer
    group** $BR(F)$, which Jean Pierre Serre identified it with **Galois
    cohomology** $H^2(K,K^*)$, where $K^*$ is the multiplicative group of
    $K$ seen as an algebraic group. Each Brauer equivalence class among
    central simple algebras (**Brauer algebras**) contains a unique division
    algebra by the Artin-Wedderburn theorem. Examples: the Brauer group of
    an algebraically closed field or finite field is trivial, the Brauer
    group of $\mathbb{R}$ is $Z_2$. Brauer groups were later defined for
    commutative rings by Maurice Auslander and Oscar Goldman and by
    Alexander Grothendieck in 1968 for schemes. Ofer Gabber extended the
    Serre result to schemes with ample line bundles. The finiteness of the
    Brauer group of a proper integral scheme is open. See

    As one can write finite sums using functions of two variables like
    $h(x,y)=x+y$ or $h(x+y,z)=x+y+z$ two variables suffice. The above form

    problem in 1956 to functions of three variables. Vladimir Arnold showed
    then (as a student at Moscow State university) in 1957 that one can do
    with two variables. The problem came from a more specific problem in
    algebra, the problem of finding roots of a polynomial
    $p(x)=x^n+a_1 x^{n-1} + \cdots a_n$ using radicals and arithmetic
    operations in the coefficients is not possible in general for
    $n \geq 5$. Erland Samuel Bring shows in 1786 that a quintic can be

    satisfies the recursion $x_{n+1}-2x_n+x_{n-1} = cf(x_n)$. The
    $1$-periodic function $f$ is assumed to be real-analytic, non-constant
    satisfying $\int_0^1 f(x)\;dx=0$. In the case $f(x)=\sin(2\pi x)$, one
    has the **Standard map**. When looking for invariant curves
    $(q(t+\alpha),q(t))$ with smooth $q$, we seek a solution of the
    nonlinear equation
    $F(q) = q(t+\alpha)-2 q(t)+ q(t-\alpha) - cf(q(t))=0$. For $c=0$, there
    is the solution $q(t)=t$. The **linearization**
    $dF(q)(u) = L u = u(t+\alpha)-2 u(t)+u(t-\alpha) -c f'(q(t)) u(t)$ is a
    bounded linear operator on $L^2(\mathbb{T})$ but not invertible for
    $c=0$ so that the **implicit function theorem** does not apply. The map
    $L u = u(t+\alpha) -2 u(t) + u(t-\alpha)$ becomes after a Fourier
    transform the diagonal matrix
    $\hat{L} \hat{u}_n = [2 \cos(n \alpha) - 2] \hat{u}_n$ which has the
    inverse diagonal entries $[2 \cos(n \alpha) - n]^{-1}$ leading to
    **small divisors**. A real number $\alpha$ is called **Diophantine** if
    there exists a constant $C$ such that for all integers $p,q$ with
    $q \neq 0$, we have $|\alpha - p/q| \geq C/q^2$. **KAM theory** assures
    that the solution $q(t)=t$ persists and remains smooth if $c$ is small.
    With **solution** the theorem means a **smooth solution**. For real
    analytic $F$, it can be real analytic. The following result is a special
    case of the **twist map theorem**.
    
    > For Diophantine $\alpha$, there is a solution of $F(q)=0$ for small
    $|c|$.
    
    The KAM theorem was predated by the **Poincaré-Siegel theorem** in
    complex dynamics which assured that if $f$ is analytic near $z=0$ and
    $f'(0)=\lambda = \exp(2 \pi i \alpha)$ with Diophantine $\alpha$, then
    there exists $u(z) = z+q(z)$ such that $f(u(z)) = u(\lambda z)$ holds in
    a small disk $0$: there is an analytic solution $q$ to the **Schröder
    equation** $\lambda z + g(z+q(z)) = q(\lambda z)$. The question about
    the existence of invariant curves is important as it determines the
    **stability**. The twist map theorem result follows also from a **strong
    implicit function theorem** initiated by John Nash and Jürgen Moser. For
    larger $c$, or non-Diophantine $\alpha$, the solution $q$ still exists
    but it is no more continuous. This is **Aubry-Mather theory**. For
    $c \neq 0$, the operator $\hat{L}$ is an almost periodic **Toeplitz
    matrix** on $l^2(\mathbb{Z})$ which is a special kind of **discrete
    Schrödinger operator**. The decay rate of the off diagonals depends on
    the smoothness of $f$. Getting control of the inverse can be technical
    [@Bourgain2005]. Even in the **Standard map** case $f(x)=\sin(x)$, the
    composition $f(q(t))$ is no more a trigonometric polynomial so that
    $\hat{L}$ appearing here is not a **Jacobi matrix in a strip**. The
    first breakthrough of the theorem in a frame work of Hamiltonian
    differential equations was done in 1954 by Andrey Kolmogorov. Jürgen
    Moser proved the discrete twist map version and Vladimir Arnold in 1963
    proved the theorem for Hamiltonian systems. The above stated result
    generalizes to higher dimensions where one looks for **invariant tori**

    Given a positive **square free** integer $d$, the **Diophantine
    equation** $x^2-d y^2=1$ is called **Pell's equation**. Solving it means
    to find a nontrivial unit in the ring $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{d}]$ because
    $(x+y \sqrt{d})(x-y \sqrt{d})=1$. The trivial solutions are
    $x=\pm 1, y=0$. Solving the equation is therefore part of the
    **Dirichlet unit problem** from algebraic number theory. Let
    $[a_0;a_1,\dots]$ denote the **continued fraction expansion** of
    $x=\sqrt{d}$. This means $a_0=[x]$ is the integer part and
    $[1/(x-a_0)]=a_1$ etc. If $x=[a_0; a_1,\dots, a_n+b_n]$, then
    $a_{n+1}=[1/b_n]$. Let $p_n/q_n = [a_0; a_1,a_2, \dots, a_n]$ denote the
    $n$'th **convergent** to the regular continued fraction of $\sqrt{d}$. A
    solution $(x_1,y_1)$ which minimizes $x$ is called the **fundamental
    solution**. The theorem tells that it is of the form $(p_n,q_n)$:
    
    > Any solution to the Pell's equation is a convergent $p_n/q_n$.
    
    One can find more solutions recursively because the ring of units in
    $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{d}]$ is $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times C_n$ for some cyclic
    group $C_n$. The other solutions $(x_k,y_k)$ can be obtained from
    $x_k + \sqrt{d} y_k = (x_1+\sqrt{d} y_1)^k$. One of the first instances,
    where the equation appeared is in the **Archimedes cattle problem**
    which is $x^2-410286423278424y^2 = 1$. The equation is named after John
    Pell, who has nothing to do with the equation. It was Euler who
    attributed the solution by mistake to Pell. It was first found by

    The case $d=2$ was solved by Carl Friedrich Gauss and by Pierre Ossian
    Bonnet in 1848. Gauss knew the theorem but never published it. In the

    For a sphere of radius $R$ for example, the Gauss curvature is $1/R^2$

    The **analytical index** of $D$ is defined as

    cyclotomic field is an Abelian field extension of the field of rational

    > Every Abelian extension $L/\mathbb{Q}$ is a subfield of a

    Abelian field extensions of $\mathbb{Q}$ are also called **class

    Abelian **Galois group** has a **conductor**, the smallest $n$ such that
    $K$ lies in the field generated by $n$'th roots of unity. Extending this
    theorem to other base number fields is **Kronecker's Jugendtraum** or
    **Hilbert's twelfth problem**. The theory of **complex multiplication**
    does the generalization for **imaginary quadratic fields**. The theorem
    was stated by Leopold Kronecker in 1853 and proven by Heinrich Martin

    there are infinitely many). Further interest came in the context of
    **Fermat's last theorem** because $x^n+y^n=z^n$ can be written as

    A symmetric square matrix $Q$ of size $n \times n$ with integer entries
    defines a **integer quadratic form**
    $Q(x) = \sum_{i,j=1}^n Q_{ij} x_i x_j$. It is called **positive** if
    $Q(x)>0$ whenever $x \neq 0$. A positive integral quadratic form is
    called **universal** if its range is $\mathbb{N}$. For example, by the
    **Lagrange four square theorem**, the form
    $Q(x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4)=x_1^2+x_2^2+x_3^2+x_4^2$ is universal. The
    **Conway-Schneeberger fifteen theorem** tells
    
    > $Q$ is universal if it has $\{1,\dots 15\}$ in the range.
    
    The interest in quadratic forms started in the 17'th century especially
    about numbers which can be represented as sums $x^2+y^2$. Lagrange, in
    1770 proved the four square theorem. In 1916, Ramajujan listed all
    diagonal quaternary forms which are universal. The 15 theorem was proven
    in 1993 by John Conway and William Schneeberger (a student of Conway's
    in a graduate course given in 1993). There is an analogue theorem for
    **integral positive quadratic forms**, these are defined by positive
    definite matrices $Q$ which take only integer values. The binary
    quadratic form $x^2+x y + y^2$ for example is integral but not an
    integer quadratic form because the corresponding matrix $Q$ has
    fractions $1/2$. In 2005, Bhargava and Jonathan Hanke proved the 290
    theorem, assuring that an integral positive quadratic form is universal
    if it contains $\{1, \dots, 290\}$ in its range. [@Conway15].

    A **sphere packing** in $\mathbb{R}^d$ is an arrangement of
    non-overlapping unit spheres in the $d$-dimensional Euclidean space
    $\mathbb{R}^d$ with volume measure $\mu$. It is known since [@Gro63]
    that packings with maximal densities exist. Denote by $B_r(x)$ the ball
    of radius $r$ centered at $x \in \mathbb{R}^d$. If $X$ is the set of
    centers of the sphere and $P=\bigcup_{x \in X} B_1(x)$ is the union of
    the unit balls centered at points in $X$, then the **density** of the
    packing is defined as
    $\Delta_d = \limsup \int_{B_r(0)} P \; d\mu/\int_{B_r(0)} 1 \; d\mu$.
    The sphere packing problem is now solved in 5 different cases:
    
    > Optimal sphere packings are known for $d=1,2,3,8,24$.
    
    The one-dimensional case $\Delta_1=1$ is trivial. The case
    $\Delta_2 = \pi/\sqrt{12}$ was known since Axel Thue in 1910 but proven
    only by Lásló Fejes Toóth in 1943. The case $d=3$ was called the
    **Kepler conjecture** as Johannes Kepler conjectured
    $\Delta_3 = \pi/\sqrt{18}$. It was settled by Thomas Hales in 1998 using
    computer assistance. A complete formal proof appeared in 2015. The case
    $d=8$ was settled by Maryna Viazovska who proved in 2017 [@Viazovska]
    that $\Delta_8 = \pi^4/384$ and also established uniqueness. The densest
    packing in the case $d=8$ is the $E_8$ lattice. The proof is based on
    linear programming bounds developed by Henry Cohn and Noam Elkies in
    2003. Later with other collaborators, she also covered the case $d=24$.
    the densest packing in dimension $24$ is the **Leech lattice**. For

    $\sum_j |\alpha_j-\beta_j| \leq \sum_j |\gamma_j|$ where $\gamma_j$ are

    Given two vectors $c \in \mathbb{R}^m$ and $b \in \mathbb{R}^n$, and a
    $n \times m$ matrix $A$, a **linear program** is the variational problem
    on $\mathbb{R}^m$ to maximize $f(x)=c \cdot x$ subject to the linear
    constraints $Ax \leq b$ and $x \geq 0$. The dual problem is to minimize
    $b \cdot y$ subject to to $A^T y \geq c ,y \geq 0$. The **maximum
    principle** for linear programming is tells that the solution is on the
    boundary of the **convex polytop** formed by the **feasable region**
    defined by the constraints.
    
    > Local optima of linear programs are global and on the boundary.
    
    Since the solutions are located on the vertices of the polytope defined
    by the constraints the **simplex algorithm** for solving linear programs
    works: start at a vertex of the polytop, then move along the edges along
    the gradient until the optimum is reached. If $A=[2,3]$ and
    $x=[x_1,x_2]$ and $b=6$ and $c=[3,5]$ we have $n=1,m=2$. The problem is
    to maximize $f(x_1,x_2)=3x_1+5x_2$ on the triangular region
    $2 x_1 + 3 x_2 \leq 6, x_1 \geq 0, x_2 \geq 0$. Start at $(0,0)$, the
    best improvement is to go to $(0,2)$ which is already the maximum.
    Linear programming is used to solve practical problems in operations
    research. The simplex algorithm was formulated by George Dantzig in
    1947. It solves random problems nicely but there are expensive cases in
    general and it is possible that cycles occur. One of the open problems
    of Steven Smale asks for a strongly polynomial time algorithm deciding
    whether a solution of a linear programming problem exists.

    A **random matrix** $A$ is given by an $n \times n$ array of
    independent, identically distributed random variables $A_{ij}$ of zero
    mean and standard deviation $1$. The eigenvalues $\lambda_j$ of
    $A/\sqrt{n}$ define a discrete measure
    $\mu_n = \sum_j \delta_{\lambda_j}$ called **spectral measure** of $A$.
    The **circular law** on the complex plane $\mathbb{C}$ is the
    probability measure $\mu_0 = 1_{D}/\pi$, where $D = \{ |z| \leq 1 \}$ is
    the unit disk. A sequence $\nu_n$ of probability measures converges
    **weakly** or **in law** to $\nu$ if for every continuous and bounded
    function $f: \mathbb{C} \to \mathbb{C}$ one has
    $\int f(z) \; d\nu_n(z) \to \int f(z) \; d\nu(z)$. The **circular law**
    is:
    
    > Almost surely, the spectral measures converge $\mu_n \to \mu_0$.
    
    One can think of $A_n$ as a sequence of larger and larger matrix valued
    random variables. The circular law tells that the eigenvalues fill out
    the unit disk in the complex plane uniformly when taking larger and
    larger matrices. It is a kind of central limit theorem. An older version
    due to Eugene Wigner from 1955 is the **semi-circular law** telling that
    in the self-adjoint case, the now real measures $\mu_n$ converge to a
    distribution with density $\sqrt{4-x^2}/(2\pi)$ on $[-2,2]$. The
    circular law was stated first by Jean Ginibre in 1965 and Vyacheslav
    Girko 1984. It was proven first by Z.D. Bai in 1997. Various authors
    have generalized it and removed more and more moment conditions. The
    latest condition was removed by Terence Tao and Van Vu in 2010, proving
    so the above \"fundamental theorem of random matrix theory\". See

    Let $M$ be a compact Riemannian surface and $T: M \to M$ a
    $C^2$-diffeomorphism. A Borel probability measure $\mu$ on $M$ is
    $T$-invariant if $\mu(T(A))=\mu(A)$ for all $A \in \mathcal{A}$. It is
    called **ergodic** if $T(A)=A$ implies $\mu(A)=1$ or $\mu(A)=0$. The
    **Hausdorff dimension** ${\rm dim}(\mu)$ of a measure $\mu$ is defined
    as the Hausdorff dimension of the smallest Borel set $A$ of full measure
    $\mu(A)=1$. The **entropy** $h_{\mu}(T)$ is the **Kolmogorov-Sinai
    entropy** of the measure-preserving dynamical system $(X,T,\mu)$. For an
    ergodic surface diffeomorphism, the **Lyapunov exponents**
    $\lambda_1,\lambda_2$ of $(X,T,\mu)$ are the logarithms of the
    eigenvalues of $A=\lim_{n \to \infty} [(dT^n(x))^* dT^n(x)]^{1/(2n)}$,
    which is a limiting Oseledec matrix and constant $\mu$ almost everywhere
    due to ergodicity. Let $\lambda(T,\mu)$ denote the Harmonic mean of
    $\lambda_1,-\lambda_2$. The **entropy-dimension-Lyapunov theorem** tells
    that for every $T$-invariant ergodic probability measure $\mu$ of $T$,
    one has:
    
    > $h_{\mu} = {\rm dim}(\mu) \lambda/2$.
    
    This formula has become famous because it relates \"entropy\",
    \"fractals\" and \"chaos\", which are all \"rock star\" notions also
    outside of mathematics. The theorem implies in the case of Lebesgue
    measure preserving symplectic transformation, where ${\rm dim}(\mu)=2$
    and $\lambda_1=-\lambda_2$ that \"entropy = Lyaponov exponent\" which is
    a **formula of Pesin** given by $h_{\mu}(T) = \lambda(T,\mu)$. A similar
    result holds for **circle diffeomorphims** or smooth interval maps,
    where $h_{\mu}(T) = {\rm dim}(\mu) \lambda(T,\mu)$. The notion of
    Hausdorff dimension was introduced by Felix Hausdoff in 1918. Entropy
    was defined in 1958 by Nicolai Kolmogorov and in general by Yakov Sinai
    in 1959, Lyapunov exponents were introduced with the work of Valery
    Oseledec in 1965. The above theorem is due to Lai-Sang Young who proved
    it in 1982. Francois Ledrapier and Lai-Sang Young proved in 1985 that in
    arbitrary dimensions, $h_{\mu} = \sum_j \lambda_j \gamma_j$, where
    $\gamma_j$ are dimensions of $\mu$ in the direction of the Oseledec
    spaces $E_j$. This is called the **Ledrappier-Young formula**. It
    implies the **Margulis-Ruelle inequality**
    $h_{\mu}(T)  \leq \sum_j \lambda_j^+(T)$, where
    $\lambda_j^+={\rm max}(\lambda_j,0)$ and $\lambda_j(T)$ are the Lyapunov
    exponents. In the case of a smooth $T$-invariant measure $\mu$ or more
    generally, for SRB measures, there is an equality
    $h_{\mu}(T)  = \sum_j \lambda_j^+(T)$ which is called the **Pesin
    formula**. See [@KH; @RuelleEckmann].

    and unstable manifolds** passing through $x_0$. One can show more and
    this is due to Sternberg who wrote a series of papers starting 1957

    An **iterated function system** is a finite set of contractions

    corresponding **Huntchingson operator** $H(A) = \sum_{i} f_i(A)$ is then
    a contraction on the **Hausdorff metric** of sets and has a unique fixed
    point called the **attractor** $S$ of the iterated function system. The
    definition of **Hausdorff dimension** is as follows: define
    $h_{\delta}^s(A) = \inf_{U \in \mathcal{U}} \sum_i |U_i|^s$, where
    $\mathcal{U}$ is a $\delta$-cover of $A$. And
    $h^s(A)=\lim_{\delta \to 0} H_{\delta}^s(A)$. The **Hausdorff
    dimension** ${\rm dim}_H(S)$ finally is the value $s$, where $h^s(S)$
    jumps from $\infty$ to $0$. If the contractions are maps with
    contraction factors $0<\lambda_j<1$ then the Hausdorff dimension of the
    attractor $S$ can be estimated with the the **similarity dimension** of
    the contraction vector $(\lambda_1, \dots, \lambda_n)$: this number is
    defined as the solution $s$ of the equation
    $\sum_{i=1}^n \lambda_i^{-s} = 1$.

    There is an equality if $f_i$ are all affine contractions like
    $f_i(x)=A_i \lambda x+\beta_i$ with the same contraction factor and
    $A_i$ are orthogonal and $\beta_i$ are vectors (a situation which
    generates a large class of popular fractals). For equality one also has
    to assume that there is an open non-empty set $G$ such that $G_i=f_i(G)$
    are disjoint. In the case $\lambda_j=\lambda$ are all the same then
    $n \lambda^{-{\rm dim}} = 1$ which implies
    ${\rm dim}(S) = -\log(n)/\log(\lambda)$. For the **Smith-Cantor set**
    $S$, where $f_1(x)=x/3+2/3, f_2(x)=x/3$ and $G=(0,1)$. One gets with
    $n=2$ and $\lambda=1/3$ the dimension ${\rm dim}(S)=\log(2)/\log(3)$.
    For the **Menger carpet** with $n=8$ affine maps
    $f_{ij}(x,y)=(x/3+i/3,y/3+j/3)$ with
    $0 \leq i \leq 2, 0 \leq j \leq 2, (i,j) \neq (1,1)$, the dimension is
    $\log(8)/\log(3)$. The **Menger sponge** is the analogue object with
    $n=20$ affine contractions in $\mathbb{R}^3$ and has dimension
    $\log(20)/\log(3)$. For the **Koch curve** on the interval, where $n=4$
    affine contractions of contraction factor $1/3$ exist, the dimension is
    $\log(4)/\log(3)$. These are all **fractals**, sets with Hausdorff
    dimension different from an integer. The modern formulation of iterated
    function systems is due to John E. Hutchingson from 1981. Michael
    Barnsley used the concept for a **fractal compression algorithms**,
    which uses the idea that storing the rules for an iterated function
    system is much cheaper than the actual attractor. Iterated function
    systems appear in complex dynamics in the case when the **Julia set** is
    completely disconnected, they have appeared earlier also in work of
    Georges de Rham 1957. See [@Mandelbrot; @Falconer].

  satz : You can't tell by looking.
  long : |
    Like the Bayes theorem or the Pigeon hole principle which both are too
    simple to qualify as \"theorems\" but still are of utmost importance, the
    \"Strong law of small numbers\" is not really a theorem but a
    **fundamental mathematical principle**. It is more fundamental than a
    specific theorem as it applies throughout mathematics. It is for example
    important in Ramsey theory: The statement is put in different ways like
    \\"There aren't enough small numbers to meet the many demands made of
    them\". [@stronglawofsmallnumbers] puts it in the following catchy way:
    
    > You can't tell by looking.
    
    The point was made by Richard Guy in [@stronglawofsmallnumbers] who
    states two \"corollaries\": **\"superficial similarities spawn spurious
    statements\"** and **\"early exceptions eclipse eventual essentials\"**.
    The statement is backed up with countless many examples (a list of 35
    are given in [@stronglawofsmallnumbers]). Famous are Fermat's claim that
    all **Fermat primes** $2^{2^n}+1$ are prime or the claim that the number
    $\pi_3(n)$ of primes of the form $4k+3$ in $\{1, \dots, n\}$ is larger
    than $\pi_1(n)$ of primes of the form $4k+1$ so that the $4k+3$ primes
    win the **prime race**. Hardy and Littlewood showed however
    $\pi_3(n)-\pi_1(n)$ changes sign infinitely often. The prime number
    theorem extended to arithmetic progressions shows
    $\pi_1(n) \sim n/(2\log(n))$ and $\pi_3(n) \sim n/(2 \log(n))$ but the
    density of numbers with $\pi_3(n)>\pi_1(n)$ is larger than $1/2$. This
    is the **Chebyshev bias**. Experiments then suggested the density to be
    $1$ but also this is false: the density of numbers for which
    $\pi_3(n)>\pi_1(n)$ is smaller than $1$. The principle is important in a
    branch of combinatorics called **Ramsey theory**. But it not only
    applies in discrete mathematics. There are many examples, where one can

    for example, one would tell that it is a fractal with Hausdorff
    dimension between $1$ and $2$. In reality the Hausdorff dimension is $2$

  long : |
    Let $G$ be the complete graph with $n$ vertices. An **edge labeling**
    with $r$ colors is an assignment of $r$ numbers to the **edges** of $G$.
    A complete sub-graph of $G$ is called a **clique**. If it is has $s$
    vertices, it is denoted by $K_s$. A graph $G$ is called
    **monochromatic** if all edges in $G$ have the same color. (We use in
    here **coloring** as a short for **edge labeling** and not in the sense
    of chromatology where an edge coloring assumes that intersecting edges
    have different colors.) Ramsey's theorem is:
    
    > For large $n$, every $r$-colored $K_n$ contains a monochromatic
    $K_s$.
    
    So, there exist **Ramsey numbers** $R(r,s)$ such that for
    $n \geq R(r,s)$, the edge coloring of one of the $s$-cliques can occur.
    A famous case is the identity $R(3,3)=6$. Take $n=6$ people. It defines
    the complete graph $G$. If two of them are friends, color the edge blue,
    otherwise red. This **friendship graph** therefore is a $r=2$ coloring
    of $G$. There are 78 possible colorings. In each of them, there is a
    triangle of friends or a triangle of strangers. In a group of 6 people,
    there are either a clique with 3 friends or a clique of 3 complete
    strangers. The Theorem was proven by Frank Ramsey in 1930. Paul Erdoes
    asked to give explicit estimated $R(s)$ which is the least integer $n$
    such that any graph on $n$ vertices contains either a **clique** of size
    $s$ (a set where all are connected to each other) or an independent set
    of size $s$ (a set where none are connected to each other). Graham for
    example asks whether the limit $R(n)^{1/n}$ exists. Ramsey theory also
    deals other sets: **van der Waerden's theorem** from 1927 for example
    tells that if the positive integers $\mathbb{N}$ are colored with $r$
    colors, then for every $k$, there exists an $N$ called $W(r,k)$ such
    that the finite set $\{1 \dots, N\}$ has an arithmetic progression with
    the same color. For example, $W(2,3)=9$. Also here, it is an open
    problem to find a formula for $W(r,k)$ or even give good upper bounds.

    For a differentiable **Riemannian $n$-manifold** $(M,g)$ there is an
    **exterior derivative** $d=d_p$ which maps $p$-forms $\Lambda^p$ to
    $(p+1)$-forms $\Lambda^{p+1}$. For $p=0$, the derivative is called the
    **gradient**, for $p=1$, the derivative is called the **curl** and for
    $p=d-1$, the derivative is the adjoint of **divergence**. The Riemannian
    metric defines an inner product $\langle f,h \rangle$ on $\Lambda^p$
    allowing so to see $\Lambda^p$ as part of a Hilbert space and to define
    the adjoint $d^*$ of $d$. It is a linear map from $\Lambda^{p+1}$ to
    $\Lambda^p$. The exterior derivative defines so the self-adjoint **Dirac
    operator** $D=d+d^*$ and the **Hodge Laplacian** $L=D^2 = d d^* + d^*d$
    which now leaves each $\Lambda^p$ invariant. **Hodge theory** assures
    that ${\rm dim}( {\rm ker} (L| \Lambda^p)) =b_p = {\rm dim}(H^p(M))$,
    where $H^p(M)$ are the $p$'th **cohomology group**, the kernel of $d_p$
    modulo the image of $d_{p-1}$. **Poincaré duality** is:
    
    > If $M$ is orientable n-manifold, then $b_k(M)=b_{n-k}(M)$.
    
    The **Hodge dual** of $f \in \Lambda^p$ is defined as the unique
    $*g \in 
    \Lambda^{n-p}$ satisfying
    $\langle f,*g \rangle = \langle f \wedge g,\omega \rangle$ where
    $\omega$ is the volume form. One has $d^* f = (-1)^{d+dp+1} *d* f$ and
    $L * f = * Lf$. This implies that $*$ is a unitary map from
    ${\rm ker}(L| \Lambda^p)$ to ${\rm ker}(L| \Lambda^{d-p})$ proving so
    the duality theorem. For $n=4k$, one has $*^2=1$, allowing to define the
    **Hirzebruch signature** $\sigma:={\rm dim}\{ u | Lu=0, *u=u \}
    - {\rm dim}(u | Lu=0, *u=-u \}$. The Poinaré duality theorem was first
    stated by Henri Poincaré in 1895. It took until the 1930ies to clean out
    the notions and make it precise. The Hodge approach establishing an
    explicit isomorphism between harmonic $p$ and $n-p$ forms appears for
    example in [@Cycon].

    Let $T$ be an automorphism of a probability space

    $A \in \mathcal{A}$. The system $T$ is called **aperiodic**, if the set
    of **periodic points**
    $P=\{ x \in \Omega \; | \;  \exists n >0, T^n x= x \}$ has measure
    $\mu(P)=0$. A set $B \in \mathcal{A}$ which has the property that
    $B,T(B), \dots, T^{n-1}(B)$ are disjoint is called a **Rokhlin tower**.
    The measure of the tower is
    $\mu(B \cup \cdots \cup T^{n-1}(B)) = n \mu(B)$. We call it an
    $(1-\epsilon)$-Rokhlin tower. We say $T$ can be **approximated arbitrary
    well** by Rokhlin towers, if for all $\epsilon >0$, there is an
    $(1-\epsilon)$ Rokhlin tower.
    
    > An aperiodic $T$ can be approximated well by Rokhlin towers.
    
    The result was proven by Vladimir Abramovich Rokhlin in his thesis 1947
    and independently by Shizuo Kakutani in 1943. The lemma can be used to
    build **Kakutani skyscrapers**, which are nice partitions associated to
    a transformation. This lemma allows to approximate an aperiodic
    transformation $T$ by a periodic transformations $T_n$. Just change $T$
    on $T^{n-1}(B)$ so that $T_n^n(x)=x$ for all $x$. The theorem has been
    generalized by Donald Ornstein and Benjamin Weiss to higher dimensions
    like $\mathbb{Z}^d$ actions of measure preserving transformations where
    the periodicity assumption is replaced by the assumption that the action
    is **free**: for any $n \neq 0$, the set $T^n(x)=x$ has zero measure.

    ${\rm \delta}$ is the geodesic distance on the flat torus and where
    $|\cdot|_{\infty}$ is the $L^{\infty}$ supremum norm. Lets call
    $(\mathbb{T}^d,T,\mu)$ a **toral dynamical system** if $T$ is a
    **homeomorphism**, a continuous transformation with continuous inverse.
    A **cube exchange transformation** on $\mathbb{T}^d$ is a periodic,
    piecewise affine measure-preserving transformation $T$ which permutes
    rigidly all the cubes $\prod_{i=1}^d [k_i/n,(k_i+1)/n]$, where
    $k_i \in \{0, \dots, n-1 \}$. Every point in $\mathbb{T}^d$ is $T$
    periodic. A cube exchange transformation is determined by a permutation
    of the set $\{1, \dots, n \}^d$. If it is cyclic, the exchange
    transformation is called **cyclic**. A theorem of Lax [@Lax71] states
    that every toral dynamical system can approximated in the metric
    $\delta$ by cube exchange transformations. The approximations can even
    be cyclic [@AlPr93].
    
    > Toral systems can be approximated by cyclic cube exchanges
    
    The result is due to Peter Lax [@Lax71]. The proof of this result uses
    Hall's marriage theorem in graph theory (for a 'book proof' of the later
    theorem, see [@AigZie]). Periodic approximations of symplectic maps work
    surprisingly well for relatively small $n$ (see [@Ran74]). On the Pesin

    **generalized functions** appeared first in the work of Oliver Heaviside
    in the form of \"operational calculus. Paul Dirac used the formalism in
    quantum mechanics. In the 1930s, Kurt Otto Friedrichs, Salomon Bocher
    and Sergei Sobolev define weak solutions of PDE's. Schwartz used the
    $C_c^{\infty}$ functions, smooth functions of compact support. This
    means that the existence of $k$ weak derivatives implies the existence
    of actual derivatives. For $p=2$, the spaces $W^k$ are Hilbert spaces
    and the theory a bit simpler due to the availability of Fourier theory,
    where tempered distributions flourished. In that case, one can define
    for any real $s>0$ the Hilbert space $H^s$ as the subset of all
    $f \in S'$ for which $(1+|\xi|^2)^{s/2} \hat{f}(\xi)$ is in $L^2$. The

    having bounded semi norms
    $||\phi||_k=\max_{|\alpha|+|\beta| \leq k} || x^{\beta} D^{\alpha} \phi||_{\infty}<\infty$
    where $\alpha,\beta \in \mathbb{N}^n$. Since $S$ is larger than the set
    of smooth functions of compact support, the dual space $S'$ is smaller.
    They are **tempered distributions**. Sobolev emedding theorems like
    above allow to show that weak solutions of PDE's are smooth: for
    example, if the Poisson problem $\Delta f = V f$ with smooth $V$ is
    solved by a distribution $f$, then $f$ is smooth.

    **sub-manifold** $G$ defining so an **integral** $\int_G F$. The
    **exterior derivative** $d: \Lambda^p \to \Lambda^{p+1}$ satisfies
    $d^2=0$ and defines an **elliptic complex**. There is a natural **Hodge
    duality** isomorphism given called \"Hodge star\"
    $*: \Lambda^p \to \Lambda^{n-p}$. Given a $p$-form $F \in \Lambda^p$ and
    a $(p+1)$-dimensional compact oriented sub-manifold $G$ of $M$ with
    boundary $\delta G$ compatible with the orientation of $G$, we have
    **Stokes theorem**:'
    
    >
    $\langle G, dF \rangle = \int_G dF = \int_{\delta G} F = \langle \delta G, F \rangle$.
    
    The theorem states that the exterior derivative $d$ is dual to the
    boundary operator $\delta$. If $G$ is a connected $1$-manifold with
    boundary, it is a curve with boundary $\delta G=\{A,B\}$. A $1$-form can
    be integrated over the curve $G$ by choosing the on $G$ induced volume
    form $r'(t) dt$ given by a **curve parametrization** $[a,b] \to G$ and
    integrate $\int_a^b F(r(t)) \cdot r'(t) dt$, which is the **line
    integral**. Stokes theorem is then the **fundamental theorem of line
    integrals**. Take a $0$-form $f$ which is a **scalar function** the
    derivative $df$ is the gradient $F=\nabla f$. Then
    $\int_a^b \nabla f(r(t)) \cdot r'(t) \; dt=f(B)-f(A)$. If $G$ is a two
    dimensional surface with boundary $\delta G$ and $F$ is a $1$-form, then
    the $2$-form $dF$ is the **curl** of $F$. If $G$ is given as a **surface
    parametrization** $r(u,v)$, one can apply $dF$ on the pair of tangent
    vectors $r_u,r_v$ and integrate this $dF(r_u,r_v)$ over the surface $G$
    to get $\int_G dF$. The **Kelvin-Stokes theorem** tells that this is the
    same than the line integral $\int_{\delta G} F$. In the case of
    $M=\mathbb{R}^3$, where $F=Pdx+Qdy+Rdz$ can be identified with a vector
    field $F=[P,Q,R]$ and $dF = \nabla \times F$ and integration of a
    $2$-form $H$ over a parametrized manifold $G$ is
    $\int \int_R H(r(u,v))(r_u,r_v) = \int \int_R H(r(u,v) \cdot r_u \times r_v du dv$
    we get the **classical Kelvin-Stokes theorem.** If $F$ is a $2$-form,
    then $dF$ is a $3$-form which can be integrated over a $3$-manifold $G$.
    As $d: \Lambda^2 \to \Lambda^3$ can via Hodge duality naturally be
    paired with $d_0^*: \Lambda^1 \to \Lambda^0$, which is the
    **divergence**, the **divergence theorem**
    $\int \int \int_G {\rm div}(F) \; dx dy dz 
    = \int\int_{\delta G} F \cdot dS$ relates a triple integral with a flux
    integral. Historical milestones start with the development of the
    **fundamental theorem of calculus** (1666 Isaac Newton, 1668 James
    Gregory, Isaac Barrow 1670 and Gottfried Leibniz 1693); the first
    rigorous proof was done by Cauchy in 1823 (the first textbook appearance
    in 1876 by Paul du Bois-Reymond). See [@BressoudPortland]. In 1762,
    Joseph-Louis Lagrange and in 1813 Karl-Friedrich Gauss look at special
    cases of divergence theorem, Mikhail Ostogradsky in 1826 and George
    Green in 1828 cover the general case. Green's theorem in two dimensions
    was first stated by Augustin-Louis Cauchy in 1846 and Bernhard Riemann
    in 1851. Stokes theorem first appeared in 1854 as an exam question but
    the theorem has appeared already in a letter of William Thomson to Lord
    Kelvin in 1850, hence also the name **Kelvin-Stokes theorem**. Vito
    Volterra in 1889 and Henri Poincaré in 1899 generalized the theorems to
    higher dimensions. Differential forms were introduced in 1899 by Élie
    Cartan. The $d$ notation for exterior derivative was introduced in 1902
    by Theodore de Donder. The ultimate formulation above is from Cartan
    1945. We followed Katz [@HistoryStokes] who noticed that only in 1959,

    $\int_0^1 x^n \; d\mu(x)$ for a Borel probability measure on $[0,1]$.
    One can study the problem also in higher dimensions: for a multi-index
    $n=(n_1,\dots, n_d)$ denote by
    $\mu_n = \int x_1^{n_1} \dots x_d^{n_d} \; d\mu(x)$ the **$n$'th

    $I^d=[0,1]^d \subset \mathbb{R}^d$. We say $\mu_n$ is a **moment
    configuration** if there exists a measure $\mu$ which has $\mu_n$ as
    moments. If $e_i$ denotes the standard basis in $\mathbb{Z}^d$, define
    the **partial difference** $(\Delta_i a)_n = a_{n-e_i}-a_n$ and
    $\Delta^k=\prod_i \Delta_i^{k_i}$. We write
    $\frac{k}{n}=\prod_{i=1}^n \frac{k_i}{n_i}$ and

    and $\sum_{k=0}^n = \sum_{k_1=0}^{n_1}  \dots \sum_{k_d=0}^{n_d}$. We
    say moments $\mu_n$ are **Hausdorff bounded** if there exists a constant
    $C$ such that
    $\sum_{k=0}^n |\left( \begin{array}{c} n \\ k \\ \end{array} \right) (\Delta^{k} \mu)_n| \leq C$

    The above result is due to Theophil Henry Hildebrandt and Isaac Jacob
    Schoenberg from 1933. [@HiSc33]. Moments also allow to compare measures:
    a measure $\mu$ is called **uniformly absolutely continuous** with
    respect to $\nu$ if there exists $f \in L^{\infty}(\nu)$ such that
    $\mu = f \nu$. A positive probability measure $\mu$ is uniformly
    absolutely continuous with respect to a second probability measure $\nu$
    if and only if there exists a constant $C$ such that
    $(\Delta^k \mu)_n \leq C \cdot (\Delta^k \nu)_n$ for all
    $k,n \in \mathbb{N}^d$. In particular it gives a generalization of a
    result of Felix Hausdorff from 1921 [@Hau21] assuring that $\mu$ is
    positive if and only if $(\Delta^k \mu)_n \geq 0$ for all

    A sequence of random variables $X_1,X_2, \dots$ on a probability space
    $(\Omega,\mathcal{A},{\rm P})$ is called a **discrete time stochastic
    process**. We assume the $X_k$ to be in $L^2$ meaning that the
    expectation ${\rm E}[X_k^2] < \infty$ for all $k$. Given a sub-$\sigma$
    algebra $\mathcal{B}$ of $\mathcal{A}$, the **conditional expectation**
    ${\rm E}[X|\mathcal{B}]$ is the projection of
    $L^2(\Omega,\mathcal{A},P)$ to $L^2(\Omega,\mathcal{B},P)$. Extreme
    cases are ${\rm E}[X|\mathcal{A}]=X$ and
    ${\rm E}[X|\{\emptyset,\Omega\}] = {\rm E}[X]$. A finite set
    $Y_1, \dots, Y_n$ of random variables generates a sub- $\sigma$-algebra
    $\mathcal{B}$ of $\mathcal{A}$, the smallest $\sigma$-algebra for which
    all $Y_j$ are still measurable. Write
    ${\rm E}[X|Y_1,\cdots ,Y_n]={\rm E}[X|\mathcal{B}]$, where $\mathcal{B}$
    is the $\sigma$-algebra generated by $Y_1, \cdots Y_n$. A discrete time
    stochastic process is called a **martingale** if
    ${\rm E}[X_{n+1} | X_1,\cdots,X_n] = {\rm E}[X_n]$ for all $n$. If the
    equal sign is replaced with $\leq$ then the process is called a
    **super-martingale**, if $\geq$ it is a **sub-martingale**. The **random
    walk** $X_n = \sum_{k=1}^n Y_k$ defined by a sequence of independent
    $L^2$ random variables $Y_k$ is an example of a martingale because
    independence implies
    ${\rm E}[X_{n+1} | X_1,\cdots,X_n] = {\rm E}[X_{n+1}]$ which is
    ${\rm E}[X_n]$ by the identical distribution assumption. If $X$ and $M$
    are two discrete time stochastic processes, define the **martingale
    transform** (=discrete Ito integral) $X \cdot M$ as the process
    $(X \cdot M)_n  = \sum_{k=1}^{n} X_k(M_k-M_{k-1})$. If the process $X$
    is **bounded** meaning that there exists a constant $C$ such that
    ${\rm E}[|X_k|] \leq C$ for all $k$, then if $M$ is a martingale, also
    $X \cdot M$ is a martingale. The **Doob martingale convergence theorem**
    is
    
    > For a bounded super martingale $X$, then $X_n$ converges in $L^1$.
    
    The convergence theorem can be used to prove the **optimal stopping time
    theorem** which tells that the expected value of a **stopping time** is
    the initial expected value. In finance it is known as the **fundamental
    theorem of asset pricing**. If $\tau$ is a stopping time adapted to a
    martingale $X_k$, it defines the random variable $X_{\tau}$ and
    ${\rm E}[X_\tau]={\rm E}[X_0]$. For a super-martingale one has $\geq$
    and for a sub-martingale $\leq$. The proof is obtained by defining the
    **stopped process**
    $X^{\tau}_n = X_0 + \sum_{k=0}^{{\rm min}(\tau,n)-1} (X_{k+1}-X_k)$
    which is a martingale transform and so a martingale. The martingale
    convergence theorem gives a limiting random variable $X_{\tau}$ and
    because ${\rm E}[X_n^{\tau}]={\rm E}[X_0]$ for all $n$,
    ${\rm E}[X_\tau]={\rm E}[X_0]$. This is rephrased as \"you can not beat
    the system\" [@WilliamsMartingales]. A trivial implication is that one
    can not for example design a strategy allowing to win in a fair game by
    designing a \"clever stopping time\" like betting on \"red\" in roulette
    if 6 times \"black\" in a row has occurred. Or to follow the strategy to
    stop the game, if one has a first positive total win, which one can
    always do by doubling the bet in case of losing a game. Martingales were
    introduced by Paul Lévy in 1934, the name \"martingale\" (referring to
    the just mentioned doubling betting strategy) was added in a 1939
    probability book of Jean Ville. The theory was developed by Joseph Leo
    Doob in his book of 1953. [@DoobStochastic]. See [@WilliamsMartingales].

  long : |
    A Riemannian metric on a two-dimensional manifold $S$ defines the
    quadratic form $I = E du^2+2Fdudv+G dv^2$ called **first fundamental
    form** on the surface. If $r(u,v)$ is a parameterization of $S$, then
    $E=r_u \cdot r_u, F=r_u \cdot r_v$ and $G=r_v \cdot r_v$. The **second
    fundamental form** of $S$ is $II=L du^2 + 2 M du dv + N dv^2$, where
    $L=r_{uu} \cdot n, M = r_{uv} \cdot n, N = r_{vv} \cdot n$, written
    using the normal vector $n=(r_u \times r_v)/|r_u \times r_v|$. The
    **Gaussian curvature**
    $K={\rm det}(II)/{\rm det}(I) = (LN-M^2)/(EG-F^2)$. depends on the
    embedding $r: R \to S$ in space $\mathbb{R}^3$, but it actually only
    depends on the intrinsic metric, the first fundamental form. This is the
    **Theorema egregium** of Gauss:
    
    > The Gaussian curvature only depends on the Riemannian metric.
    
    Gauss himself already gave explicit formulas, but a formula of
    **Brioschi** gives the curvature $K$ explicitly as a ratio of
    determinants involving $E,F,G$ as well as and first and second
    derivatives of them. In the case when the surface is given as a graph
    $z=f(x,y)$, one can give $K= D/(1+|\nabla f|^2)^2$, where
    $D=(f_{xx} f_{yy} - f_{xy}^2)$ is the **discriminant** and
    $(1+|\nabla f|^2)^2= {\rm det}(II)$. If the surface is rotated in space
    so that $(u,v)$ is a critical point for $f$, then the **discriminant**
    $D$ is equal to the curvature. One can see the independence of the
    embedding also from the **Puiseux formula**
    $K = 3 (|S_0(r)|-S(r))/(\pi r^3)$, where $|S_0(r)|=2\pi r$ is the
    circumference of the circle $S_0(r)$ in the flat case and $|S(r)|$ is
    the circumference of the **geodesic circle** of radius $r$ on $S$. The
    theorem Egregium also follows from Gauss-Bonnet as the later allows to
    write the curvature in terms of the angle sum of a geodesic
    infinitesimal triangle with the angle sum $\pi$ of a flat triangle. As
    the angle sums are entirely defined intrinsically, the curvature is
    intrinsic. The Theorema Egregium was found by Karl-Friedrich Gauss in
    1827 and published in 1828 in \"Disquisitiones generales circa
    superficies curvas\". It is not an accident, that Gauss was occupied
    with concrete geodesic triangulation problems too.

  area : Entropy
  satz : Any normalized, additive and multiplicative $H$ is entropy $S$.
  long : |
    Given a random variable $X$ on a probability space
    $(\Omega,\mathcal{A},{\rm P})$ which is **finite and discrete** in the
    sense that it takes only finitely many values, the **entropy** is
    defined as $S(X)  = -\sum_{x} p_x \log(p_x)$, where
    $p_x = {\rm P}[ X=x ]$. To compare, for a random variable $X$ with
    cumulative distribution function $F(x) = {\rm P}[X \leq x]$ having a
    continuous derivative $F'=f$, the entropy is defined as
    $S(X) = - \int f(x) \log(f(x)) \; dx$, allowing the value $-\infty$ if
    the integral does not converge. (We always read $p \log(p)=0$ if $p=0$.)
    In the continuous case, one also calls this the **differential
    entropy**. Two discrete random variables $X,Y$ are called
    **independent** if one can realize them on a product probability space
    $\Omega = A \times B$ so that $X(a,b) = X(a)$ and $Y(a,b) = Y(b)$ for
    some functions $X:A \to \mathbb{R}, Y:B \to \mathbb{R}$. Independence
    implies that the random variables are uncorrelated,
    ${\rm E}[X Y ] = {\rm E}[X] {\rm E}[Y]$ and that the **entropy adds up**
    $S(X Y) = S(X) + S(Y)$. We can write $S(X) = {\rm E}[ \log(W(x)) ]$,
    where $W$ is the \"Wahrscheinlichkeit\" random variable assigning to
    $\omega \in \Omega$ the value $W(\omega)=1/p_x$ if $X(\omega)=x$. Let us
    say, a functional on discrete random variables is **additive** if it is
    of the form $H(X) = \sum_x f(p_x)$ for some continuous function $f$ for
    which $f(t)/t$ is monotone. We say it is **multiplicative** if
    $H(X Y) = H(X) + H(Y)$ for independent random variables. The functional
    is **normalized** if $H(X)=\log(4)$ if $X$ is a random variable taking
    two values $\{0,1\}$ with probability $p_0=p_1=1/2$. Shannon's theorem
    is:
    
    > Any normalized, additive and multiplicative $H$ is entropy $S$.
    
    The word \"entropy\" was introduced by Rudolf Clausius in 1850
    [@RovelliTime]. Ludwig Bolzmann saw the importance of
    $\frac{d}{dt} S \geq 0$ in the context of heat and wrote in 1872
    $S=k_B \log(W)$, where $W(x)=1/p_x$ is the inverse \"Wahrscheinlichkeit\"
    that a state has the value $x$. His equation is understood as the
    expectation $S=k_B {\rm E}[\log(W)] = \sum_x p_x \log(W(x))$ which is
    the **Shannon entropy**, introduced in 1948 by Claude Shannon in the
    context of information theory. (Shannon characterized functionals $H$
    with the property that if $H$ is continuous in $p$, then for random
    variables $H_n$ with $p_x(H_n)=1/n$, one has $H(X_n)/n \leq H(X_m)/m$ if
    $n \leq m$ and if $X,Y$ are two random variables so that the finite
    $\sigma$-algebras $\mathcal{A}$ defined by $X$ is a sub-$\sigma$-algebra
    $\mathcal{B}$ defined by $Y$, then $H(Y) = H(X) + \sum_x p_x H(Y_x)$,
    where $Y_x(\omega)=Y(\omega)$ for $\omega \in \{ X =x \}$. One can show
    that these Shannon conditions are equivalent to the combination of being
    additive and multiplicative. In statistical thermodynamics, where $p_x$
    is the probability of a **micro-state**, then $k_B S$ is also called the
    **Gibbs entropy**, where $k_B$ is the **Boltzmann constant**. For
    general random variables $X$ on $(\Omega,\mathcal{A},{\rm P})$ and a
    finite $\sigma$-sub-algebra $\mathcal{B}$, Gibbs looked in 1902 at
    **course grained entropy**, which is the entropy of the conditional
    expectation $Y={\rm E}[X|\mathcal{B}|$, which is now a random variable
    $Y$ taking only finitely many values so that entropy is defined. See
    [@Shannon48].

  long : |
    Let $H$ be a **Hilbert space**, and let $f$ be a twice Fréchet
    differentiable function from $H$ to $\mathbb{R}$. The **Fréchet
    derivative** $A=f'$ at a point $x \in H$ is a linear operator $A$
    satisfying $f(x+h)-f(x)- A h = o(h)$ for all $h \to 0$. A point
    $x \in H$ is called a **critical point** of $f$ if $f'(x)=0$. The
    functional satisfies the **Palais-Smale condition**, if every sequence
    $x_k$ in $H$ for which $\{ f(x_k) \}$ is bounded and $f'(x_k) \to 0$,
    has a convergent subsequence in the closure of
    $\{ x_k \}_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$. A pair of points $a,b \in H$ defines a
    **mountain pass**, if there exist $\epsilon>0$ and $r>0$ such that
    $f(x) \geq f(a)+\epsilon$ on $S_r(a) = \{ x \in H \; | \; ||x-a||=r \}$,
    $f$ is not constant on $S_r(a)$ and $f(b) \leq f(a)$. A critical point
    is called a **saddle** if it is neither a maximum nor a minimum of $f$.
    
    > If a Palais-Smale $f$ has a mountain pass, it features a saddle.
    
    The idea is to look at all continuous paths $\gamma$ from $a$ to $b$
    parametrized by $t \in [0,1]$. For each path $\gamma$, the value
    $c_{\gamma} = f(\gamma(t))$ has to be maximal for some time
    $t \in [0,1]$. The infimum over all these critical values $c_{\gamma}$
    is a critical value of $f$. The mountain pass condition leads to a
    \"mountain ridge\" and the critical point is a \"mountain pass\", hence
    the name. The example $(2\exp(-x^2-y^2)-1)(x^2+y^2)$ with
    $a=(0,0),b=(1,0)$ shows that the non-constant condition is necessary for
    a saddle point on $S_{r}(a)$ with $r=1/2$. The reason for sticking with
    a Hilbert space is that it is easier to realize the compactness
    condition due to weak star compactness of the unit ball. But it is
    possible to weaken the conditions and work with a Banach manifolds $X$
    continuous Gâteaux derivatives: $f': X \to X^*$ if $X$ has the strong
    and $X^*$ the weak-$*$ topology. It is difficult to pinpoint
    historically the first use of the mountain pass principle as it must
    have been known intuitively since antiquity. The crucial Palais-Smale
    **compactness condition** which makes the theorem work in infinite
    dimensions appeared in 1964. [@AubinEkeland] calls it condition (C), a
    notion which already appeared in the original paper [@PalaisSmale].

  long : |
    Given a smooth function $f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ which maps
    integers to integers, one can look at **exponential sums**
    $\sum_{x=a}^b \exp(i \pi f(x))$ An example is the **Gaussian sum**
    $\sum_{x=0}^{n-1} \exp(i \alpha x^2)$. There are lots of interesting
    relations and estimates. One of the magical formulas is the
    **Landsberg-Schaar relations** for the finite sums
    $S(q,p) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{p}} \sum_{x=0}^{p-1} \exp(i \pi x^2 q/p)$.
    
    > If $p,q$ are positive and odd integers, then
    $S(2q,p) = e^{i \pi/4}  S(-p,2q)$.
    
    One has $S(1,p) = (1/\sqrt{p}) \sum_{x=0}^{p-1} \exp(i x^2/p) = 1$ for
    all positive integers $p$ and
    $S(2,p) = (e^{i \pi/4}/\sqrt{p}) \sum_{x=0}^{p-1} \exp(2 i x^2/p) = 1$
    if $p=4k+1$ and $i$ if $p=4k-1$. The method of exponential sums has been
    expanded especially by Vinogradov's papers [@Vinogradov] and used for
    number theory like for quadratic reciprocity [@MurtyPacelli]. The topic
    is of interest also outside of number theory. Like in dynamical systems
    theory as Fürstenberg has demonstrated. An ergodic theorist would look
    at the dynamical system $T(x,y) = (x+2y+1,y+1)$ on the 2-torus
    $\mathbb{T}^2=\mathbb{R}^2/(\pi \mathbb{Z})^2$ and define
    $g_{\alpha} (x,y)=\exp(i \pi x \alpha)$. Since the orbit of this toral
    map is $T^n(1,1) = (n^2,n)$, the exponential sum can be written as a
    **Birkhoff sum** $\sum_{k=0}^{p-1} g_{q/p}(T^k(1,1))$ which is a
    particular orbit of a dynamical system. Results as those mentioned above
    show that the random walk grows like $\sqrt{p}$, similarly as in a
    random setting. Now, since the dynamical system is minimal, the growth
    rate should not depend on the initial point and $\pi q/p$ should be
    replaceable by any irrational $\alpha$ and no more be linked to the
    length of the orbit. The problem is then to study the growth rate of the
    **stochastic process** $S^t(x,y) = \sum_{k=0}^{t-1} g(T^k(x,y))$ (=
    sequence of random variables) for any continuous $g$ with zero
    expectation which by Fourier boils down to look at exponential sums. Of
    course $S^t(x,y)/t \to 0$ by Birkhoff's ergodic theorem, but as in the
    law of iterated logarithm one is interested in precise growth rates.
    This can be subtle. Already in the simpler case of an integrable
    $T(x)=x+\alpha$ on the $1$-torus, there is Denjoy-Koskma theory which
    shows that the growth rate depends on Diophantine properties of
    $\pi \alpha$. Unlike for irrational rotations, the Fürstenberg type skew
    systems $T$ leading to the theta functions are not integrable: it is not
    conjugated to a group translation (there is some randomness, even-so
    weak as Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy is zero). The dichotomy between
    structure and randomness and especially the similarities between
    dynamical and number theoretical set-ups has been discussed in
    [@TaoStructureRandomness].

    A compact **Riemannian manifold** $M$ is said to have **positive
    curvature**, if all **sectional curvatures** are positive. The
    **sectional curvature** at a point $x \in M$ in the direction of the
    2-dimensional plane $\Sigma \subset T_xM$ is defined as the Gaussian
    curvature of the surface $\exp_x(\Sigma) \subset M$ at the point. In
    terms of the **Riemannian curvature tensor** $R: T_xM^4 \to \mathbb{R}$
    and an orthonormal basis $\{u,v\}$ spanning $\Sigma$, this is
    $R(u,v,u,v)$. The curvature is called **quarter pinched**, if it the
    sectional curvature is in the interval $(1,4]$ at all points $x \in M$.
    In particular, a quarter pinched manifold is a manifold with positive
    curvature. We say here, a compact Riemannian manifold **is a sphere** if
    it is homeomorphic to a sphere. The **sphere theorem** is:
    
    > A simply-connected quarter pinched manifold is a sphere
    
    The theorem was proven by Marcel Berger and Wilhelm Klingenberg in 1960.
    That a pinching condition would imply a manifold to be a sphere had been
    conjectured already by Heinz Hopf. Hopf himself proved in 1926 that
    constant sectional curvature implies that $M$ is even isometric to a
    sphere. Harry Rauch, after visiting Hopf in Zürich in the 1940's proved
    that a 3/4-pinched simply connected manifold is a sphere. In 2007, Simon
    Brendle and Richard Schoen proved that the theorem even holds if the
    statement **$M$ is a d-sphere** (meaning that $M$ is diffeomorphic to
    the Euclidean d-sphere $\{ |x|^2=1 \} \subset \mathbb{R}^{d+1}$). This
    is the **differentiable sphere theorem**. Since John Milnor had given in
    1956 examples of spheres which are homeomorphic but not diffeomorphic to
    the standard sphere (so called **exotic spheres**, spheres which carry a
    smooth maximal atlas different from the standard one), the
    differentiable sphere theorem is a substantial improvement on the
    topological sphere theorem. It needed completely new techniques,
    especially the **Ricci flow** $\dot{g} = - 2 {\rm Ric}(g)$ of Richard
    Hamilton which is a weakly parabolic partial differential equation
    deforming the metric $g$ and uses the **Ricci curvature** ${\rm Ric}$ of

    whether a given set of two words $v,w$ represent the same group element
    in $G$ or not. The word problem is not solvable in general. There are
    concrete finitely presented groups in which it is not. The following
    theorem of Boone and Higman relates the solvability to algebra. A group

    group or then the group itself.
    
    > Finitely presented simple groups have a solvable word problem.
    
    More generally, if $G \subset H \subset K$ where $H$ is simple and $K$
    is finitely presented, then $G$ has a solvable word problem. Max Dehn
    proposed the word problem in 1911. Pyotr Novikov in 1955 proved that the
    word problem is undecidable for finitely presented groups. William W.
    Boone and Graham Higman proved the theorem in 1974 [@BooneHigman].
    Higman would in the same year also find an example of an infinite
    finitely presented simple group. The non-solvability of the word problem

    There are 18 so called **regular families** of finite simple groups made

    of the group as this defines the Cayley graph and so a metric on the
    group. The lower bound $18$ had already been known in 1980 as counting
    the possible moves with $17$ moves produces less elements. The lower
    bound 20 came in 1995 when Michael Reid proved that the **superflip
    position** (where the edges are all flipped but corners are correct)
    needs 20 moves. In July 2010, using about 35 CPU years, a team around
    Tomas Rokicki established that the God number is 20. They partitioned
    the possible group positions into roughly 2 billion sets of 20 billions
    positions each. Using symmetry they reduced it to 55 million positions,
    then found solutions for any of the positions in these sets.
    [@GodNumber] It appears silly to put a God number computation as a
    fundamental theorem, but the status of the Rubik cube is enormous as it
    has been one of the most popular puzzles for decades and is a
    **prototype** for many other similar puzzles, the choice can be
    defended. [^1] One can ask to compute the god number of any finitely
    presented finite group. Interesting in general is the complexity of
    evaluating that functional. The simplest nontrivial **Rubik cuboid** is
    the $2 \times 2 \times 1$ one. It has $6$ positions and $2$ generators
    $a,b$. The finitely presented group is $\{ a,b | a^2=b^2=(ab)^3=1 \}$
    which is the **dihedral group** $D_3$. Its group elements are
    $G=\{ 1,a=babab,ab=baba,aba=bab,abab=ba,ababa=b \}$. The group is
    isomorphic to the **symmetry group of the equilateral triangle**,
    generated by the two reflections $a,b$ at two altitude lines. The God
    number of that group is 3 because the Cayley graph $\Gamma$ is the
    cyclic graph $C_6$. The puzzle solver has here \"no other choice than
    solving the puzzle\" than to make non-trivial move in each step. See
    [@Joyner] or [@Baumslag] for general combinatorial group theory.

  satz : The critical set of $f:M \to N$ has zero volume measure in $N$.
  long : |
    Let $f: M \to N$ be a smooth map between smooth manifolds $M,N$ of
    dimension ${\rm dim}(M)=m$ and ${\rm dim}(N)=n$. A point $x \in M$ is
    called a **critical point** of $f$, if the Jacobian $n \times m$ matrix
    $df(x)$ has rank both smaller than $m$ and $n$. If $C$ is the set of
    critical points, then $f(C) \subset N$ is called the **critical set** of
    $f$. The **volume measure** on $N$ is a choice of a volume form,
    obtained for example after introducing a Riemannian metric. **Sard**'s
    theorem is
    
    > The critical set of $f:M \to N$ has zero volume measure in $N$.
    
    The theorem applied to smooth map $f: M \to \mathbb{R}$ tells that for
    almost all $c$, the set $f^{-1}(c)$ is a smooth hypersurface of $M$ or
    then empty. The later can happen if $f$ is constant. We assumed
    $C^{\infty}$ but one can relax the smoothness assumption of $f$. If
    $n \geq m$, then $f$ needs only to be continuously differentiable. If
    $n < m$, then $f$ needs to be in $C^{m-n+1}$. The case when $N$ is
    one-dimensional has been covered by Antony Morse (who is unrelated to
    Marston Morse) in 1939 and by Arthur Sard in general in 1942. A bit
    confusing is that Marston Morse (not Antony) covered the case $m=1,2,3$
    and Sard in the case $m=4,5,6$ in unpublished papers before as mentioned
    in a footnote to [@Sard42]. Sard also notes already that examples of
    Hassler Whitney show that the smoothness condition can not be relaxed.
    Sard formulated the results for $M=\mathbb{R}^m$ and $N=\mathbb{R}^n$
    (by the way with the same choice $f: M \to N$ as done here and not as in
    many other places). The manifold case appears for example in

  long : |
    An **elliptic curve** is a plane algebraic curve defined by the points
    satisfying the **Weierstrass equation** $y^2=x^3+ax+b=f(x)$. One assumes
    the curve to be **non-singular**, meaning that the **discriminant**
    $\Delta = -16(4a^3+27b^2)$ is not zero. This assures that there are no
    cusps nor multiple roots for the simple reason that the explicit
    solution formulas for roots of $f(x)=0$ involves only square roots of
    $\Delta$. A curve is an **Abelian variety**, if it carries an Abelian
    algebraic group structure, meaning that the addition of a point defines
    a morphism of the variety.
    
    > Elliptic curves are Abelian varieties.
    
    The theorem seems first have been realized by Henry Poincaré in 1901.
    Weierstrass before had used the Weierstrass $\mathcal{P}$ function
    earlier in the case of elliptic curves over the complex plane. To define
    the group multiplication, one uses the **chord-tangent construction**:
    first add point $O$ called the **point at infinity** which serves as the
    **zero** in the group. Then define $-P$ as the point obtained by
    reflecting at the $x$-axes. The **group multiplication** between two
    different points $P,Q$ on the curve is defined to be $-R$ if $R$ is the
    point of intersection of the line through $P,Q$ with the curve. If
    $P=Q$, then $R$ is defined to be the intersection of the tangent with
    the curve. If there is no intersection that is if $P=Q$ is an inflection
    point, then one defines $P+P=-P$. Finally, define $P+O=O+P=P$ and
    $P+(-P)=0$. This recipe can be explicitly given in coordinates allowing
    to define the multiplication in any field of characteristic different
    from $2$ or $3$. The group structure on elliptic curves over finite
    fields provides a rich source of **finite Abelian groups** which can be
    used for cryptological purposes, the so called **elliptic curve
    cryptograph** ECC. Any procedure, like public key, Diffie-Hellman or
    factorization attacks on integers can be done using groups given by
    elliptic curves. [@FultonAlgebraicCurves].

  area : Billiards
  satz : The Bunimovich stadium billiard is chaotic.
  long : |
    Billiards are the geodesic flow on a smooth compact $n$-manifold $M$
    with boundary. The dynamics is extended through the boundary by applying
    the law of reflection. While the flow of the geodesic $X^t$ is
    Hamiltonian on the unit tangent bundle $SM$, the billiard flow is only
    piecewise smooth and also the return map to the boundary is not
    continuous in general but it is a map preserving a natural volume so
    that one can look at ergodic theory. Already difficult are flat
    2-manifolds $M$ homeomorphic to a disc having convex boundary
    homeomorphic to a circle. For smooth convex tables this leads to a
    return map $T$ on the annulus $X=\mathbb{T} \times [-1,1]$ which is
    $C^{r-1}$ smooth if the boundary is $C^{r}$ [@Dou82]. It defines a
    **monotone twist map**: in the sense that it preserves the boundary, is
    area and orientation preserving and satisfies the **twist condition**
    that $y \to T(x,y)$ is strictly monotone. A **Bunimovich stadium** is
    the 2-manifold with boundary obtained by taking the convex hull of two
    discs of equal radius in $\mathbb{R}$ with different center. The
    billiard map is called **chaotic**, if it is ergodic and the
    **Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy** is positive. By Pesin theory, this metric
    entropy is the **Lyapunov exponent** which is the exponential growth
    rate of the Jacobian $dT^n$ (and constant almost everywhere due to
    ergodicity). There are coordinates in the tangent bundle of the annulus
    $X$ in which $dT$ is the composition of a horizontal shear with strength
    $L(x,y)$, where $L$ is the trajectory length before the impact with a
    vertical shear with strength $-2 \kappa/\sin(\theta)$ where $\kappa(x)$
    is the curvature of the curve at the impact $x$ and $y=\cos(\theta)$,
    with **impact angle** $\theta \in [0,\pi]$ between the tangent and the
    trajectory.
    
    > The Bunimovich stadium billiard is chaotic.
    
    Jacques Hadmard in 1898 and Emile Artin in 1924 already looked at the
    geodesic flow on a surface of constant negative curvature. Yakov Sinai
    constructed in 1970 the first chaotic billiards, the Lorentz gas or
    Sinai billiard. An example, where Sinai's result applies is the
    hypocycloid $x^{1/3} + y^{1/3}=1$. The Bernoulli property was
    established by Giovanni Gallavotti and Donald Ornstein in 1974. In 1973,
    Vladimir Lazutkin proved that a generic smooth convex two-dimensional
    billiard can not be ergodic due to the presence of KAM whisper galleries
    using Moser's twist map theorem. These galleries are absent in the
    presence of flat points (by a theorem of John Mather) or points, where
    the curvature is unbounded (by a theorem of Andrea Hubacher). Leonid
    Bunimovich constructed in 1979 the first convex chaotic billiard. No
    smooth convex billiard table with positive Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy is
    known. A candidate is the real analytic $x^4+y^4=1$. Various
    generalizations have been considered like in [@Woj86]. A detailed proof
    that the Bunimovich stadium is measure theoretically conjugated to a
    Bernoulli system (the shift on a product space) is surprisingly
    difficult: one has to show positive Lyapunov exponents on a set of
    positive measure. Applying Pesin theory with singularities
    (Katok-Strelcyn theory) gives a Markov process. One needs then to
    establish ergodicity using a method of Eberhard Hopf of 1936 which
    requires to understand stable and unstable manifolds

  satz : A Riemann surface is equivalent to one with constant curvature.
  long : |
    A **Riemann surface** is a one-dimensional **complex manifold**. This
    means is is a connected two dimensional manifold so that the transition
    functions o the atlas are holomorphic mappings of the complex plane. It
    is **simply connected** if its fundamental group is trivial meaning that
    its genus $b_1$ is zero. Two Riemann surfaces are **conformally
    equivalent** or simply **equivalent** if they are equivalent as complex
    manifolds, that is if a bijective morphism $f$ between them exists. A
    map $f:S \to S'$ is holmorphic if for every choice of coordinates
    $\phi:S \to \mathbb{C}$ and $\psi':S' \to \mathbb{C}$, the maps
    $\phi' \circ f \circ \phi^{-1}$ is holomorphic. The **curvature** is the
    Gaussian curvature of the surface. The **uniformization theorem** is:
    
    > A Riemann surface is equivalent to one with constant curvature.
    
    This is a \"geometrization statement\" and means that the universal cover
    of every Riemann surface is conformally equivalent to either a **Riemann
    sphere** (positive curvature), a **complex plane** (zero curvature) or a
    **unit disk** (negative curvature). It implies that any region
    $G \subset \mathbb{C}$ whose complement contains 2 or more points has a
    universal cover which is the disk which especially implies the **Riemann
    mapping theorem** assuring that and region $U$ homeomorphic to a disk is
    conformally equivalent to the unit disk. (see [@Carlson]. For a detailed
    treatement of compact Riemann surfaces, see [@GirondoGonzalezDiez]. It
    also follows that all **Riemann surfaces** (without restriction of
    genus) can be obtained as quotients of these three spaces: for the
    sphere one does not have to take any quotient, the genus 1 surfaces =
    **elliptic curves** can be obtained as quotients of the complex plane
    and any genus $g>1$ surface can be obtained as quotients of the unit
    disk. Since every closed $2$-dimensional orientable surface is
    characterized by their genus $g$, the uniformization theorem implies
    that any such surface admits a metric of constant curvature. Teichmüller
    theory parametrizes the possible metrics, and there are $3g-3$
    dimensional parameters for $g \geq 2$, whereas for $g=0$ there is one
    and for $g=1$ a moduli space $\mathbb{H}/SL_2(\mathbb{Z})$. In higher
    dimensions, close to the uniformization theorem comes the **Killing-Hopf
    theorem** telling that every connected complete Riemannian manifold of
    **constant sectional curvature** and dimension $n$ is isometric to the
    quotient of a sphere $\mathbb{S}^n$, Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^n$ or
    Hyperbolic $n$-space $\mathbb{H}^n$. Constant curvature geometry is
    either Elliptic, Parabolic=Euclidean or Hyperbolic geometry. Complex
    analysis has rich applications in complex dynamics

    A **Kalman filter** is an optional estimates algorithm of a linear

    similar as in a **dynamic Bayesian network** or **hidden Markov model**.
    It applies both to **differential equations**
    $\dot{x}(t) = A x(t) + B u(t) + G z(t)$ as well as **discrete dynamical
    system** $x(t+1)=A x(t) + B u(t) + G z(t)$, where $u(t)$ is **external
    input** and $z(t)$ **input noise** given by independent identically
    distributed usually Gaussian **random variables**. Kalman calls this a
    **Wiener problem**. One does not see the **state** $x(t)$ of the system
    but some **output** $y(t) = C x(t) + D u(t)$. The filter then \"filters
    out\" or \"learns\" the best estimate $x^*(t)$ from the observed data
    $y(t)$. The linear space $X$ is defined as the vector space spanned by
    the already observed vectors. The optimal solution is given by a
    sophisticated dynamical data fitting.
    
    > The optimal estimate $x^*$ is the projection of $y$ onto $X$.
    
    This is the informal 1-sentence description which can be found already
    in Kalman's article. Kalman then gives explicit formulas which generate
    from the **stochastic difference equation** a concrete **deterministic
    linear system**. For a modern exposition, see
    [@MarchthalerDinglerKalman]. This is the **Kalman filter**. It is named
    after Rudolf Kalman who wrote [@Kalman] in 1960. Kalman's paper is one
    of the most cited papers in applied mathematics. The ideas were used in
    the Apollo and Space Shuttle program. Similar ideas have been introduced
    in statistics by the Danish astronomer Thorvald Thiele and the radar
    theoretician Peter Swerling. There are also nonlinear version of the
    Kalman filter which is used in nonlinear state estimation like
    navigation systems and GPS. The nonlinear version uses a multi-variate

  satz : Any closed point of a normal complex variety is unibranch.
  long : |
    A **variety** is called **normal** if it can be covered by open affine
    varieties whose rings of functions are normal. A commutative ring is
    called **normal** if it has no non-zero nilpotent elements and is
    integrally closed in its complete ring of fractions. For a curve, a
    one-dimensional variety, normality is equivalent to being non-singular
    but in higher dimensions, a normal variety still can have singularities.
    The normal complex variety is called **unibranch at a point $x \in X$**
    if there are arbitrary small neighborhoods $U$ of $x$ such that the set
    of non-singular points of $U$ is connected. **Zariski's main theorem**
    can be stated as:
    
    > Any closed point of a normal complex variety is unibranch.
    
    Oscar Zariski proved the theorem in 1943. To cite [@Mumford2013], *\"it
    was the final result in a foundational analysis of birational maps
    between varieties. The 'main Theorem' asserts in a strong sense that the
    normalization (the integral closure) of a variety X is the maximal
    variety $X'$ birational over X, such that the fibres of the map
    $X' \to X$ are finite. A generalization of this fact became Alexandre
    Grothendieck's concept of the 'Stein factorization' of a map.* The
    result has been generalized to schemes $X$, which is called
    **unibranch** at a point $x$ if the local ring at $x$ is unibranch. A
    generalization is the **Zariski connectedness theorem** from 1957: if
    $f:X \to Y$ is a birational projective morphism between Noetherian
    integral schemes, then the inverse image of every normal point of $Y$ is
    connected. Put more colloquially, the fibres of a birational morphism
    from a projective variety $X$ to a normal variety $Y$ are connected. It
    implies that a birational morphism $f:X \to Y$ of algebraic varieties
    $X,Y$ is an open embedding into a neighbourhood of a normal point $y$ if
    $f^{-1}(y)$ is a finite set. Especially, a birational morphism between
    normal varieties which is bijective near points is an isomorphism.

    Henry Poincaré conjectured this in 1904. It remained the **Poincaré
    conjecture** until its proof of Grigori Perelman in 2006 [@Morgan2007].
    In higher dimensions the statement was known as the **generalized
    Poincaré conjecture**, the case $n>4$ had been proven by Stephen Smale
    in 1961 and the case $n=4$ by Michael Freedman in 1982. A **$d$-homotopy
    sphere** is a closed d-manifold that is homotopic to a $d$-sphere. (A
    manifold $M$ is **homotopic** to a manifold $N$ if there exists a
    continuous map $f: M \to N$ and a continuous map $g: N \to M$ such that
    the composition $g \circ f: M \to M$ is homotopic to the identity map on
    $M$ (meaning that there exists a continuous map $F:M \times [0,1] \to M$
    such that $F(x,0)=g(f(x))$ and $F(x,1) = x$) and the map
    $f \circ g: N \to N$ is homotopic to the identity on $N$.) The Poincaré
    conjecture itself, the case $d=3$, was proven using a theory built by
    **Richard Hamilton** who suggested to use the **Ricci flow** to solve
    the conjecture and more generally the **geometrization conjecture** of
    William Thurston: every closed 3-manifold can be decomposed into **prime
    manifolds** which are of 8 types, the so called **Thurston geometries**
    $S^3,E^3,H^3,S^2 \times R,H^2 \times R,\tilde{SL}(2,R),{\rm Nil},{\rm Solv}$.
    If the statement **M is a sphere** is replaced by **$M$ is diffeomorphic
    to a sphere**, one has the **smooth Poincaré conjecture**. Perelman's
    proof verifies this also in dimension $d=3$. The smooth Poincaré
    conjecture is false in dimension $d \geq 7$ as $d$-spheres then admit
    non-standard smooth structures, so called exotic spheres constructed
    first by John Milnor. For $d=5$ it is true following result of Dennis
    Barden from 1964. It is also true for $d=6$. For $d=4$, it is open, and

    abstract edges of the graph are then realized as actual curves in the
    plane connecting two vertices. The embedding of $G$ in the plane
    subdivides the plane into a finite collection $F$ of simply connected
    regions called **faces**. Let $v=|V|$ is the number of vertices, $e=|E|$
    the number of edges and $f=|F|$ is the number of faces. A planar graph
    is called **polyhedral** if it can be realized as a **convex
    polyhedron**, a convex hull of finitely many points in $\mathbb{R}^3$. A
    graph is called **$3$-connected**, if it remains connected also after
    removing one or two of its vertices. A connected, planar 3-connected
    graph is also called a 3-polyhedral graph. The **Polyhedral formula of

    $\Leftrightarrow$ polyhedral.
    
    The Euler polyhedron formula which was first seen in examples by René
    Descartes [@Aczel] but seen by Euler in 1750 to work for general planar
    graphs. Euler already gave an induction proof (also in 1752) but the
    first complete proof appears having been given first by Legendre in
    1794. The Steinitz theorem was proven by Ernst Steinitz in 1922, even so
    he obtained the result already in 1916. In general, a planar graph
    always defines a finite generalized CW complex in which the faces are
    the 2-cells, the edges are the 1-cells and the vertices are the 0-cells.
    The embedding in the plane defines then a **geometric realization** of
    this combinatorial structure as a topological 2-sphere. But the
    realization is not necessarily be achievable in the form of a convex
    polyhedron. Take a **tree graph** for example, a connected graph without
    triangles and without closed loops. It is planar but it is not even
    2-connected. The number of vertices $v$ and the number of edges $e$
    satisfy $v-e=1$. After embedding the tree in the plane, we have one face
    so that $f=1$. The Euler polyhedron formula $v-e+f=2$ is verified but
    the graph is not polyhedral. Even in the extreme case where $G$ is a
    one-point graph, the Euler formula holds: in that case there is $v=1$
    vertex, $e=0$ edges and $f=1$ faces (the complement of the point in the
    plane) and still $v-e+f=2$. The 3-connectedness assures that the
    realization can be done using convex polyhedra. It is even possible to
    have force the vertices of the polyhedron to be on the integer lattice.

    Hilbert in 1915. Einstein published in the same year the **general
    theory of relativity**. In the case of a **vacuum**: $T=0$, solutions
    $g$ define **Einstein manifolds** $(M,g)$. An example of a solution to
    the vaccuum Einstein equations different from the flat space solution is
    the **Schwarzschild solution**, which was found also in 1915 and
    published in 1916. It is the metric given in spherical coordinates as
    $-(1-r/\rho) c^2 dt^2+(1-r/\rho)^{-1} d\rho^2 + \rho^2 d\phi^2+\rho^2 \sin^2\phi d\theta^2$,
    where $r$ is the **Schwarzschild radius**, $\rho$ the distance to the
    singularity, $\theta,\phi$ are the standard **Euler angles**
    (**longitude** and **colatitude**) in calculus. The metric solves the
    Einstein equations for $\rho>r$. The flat metric
    $-c^2 dt^2+d\rho^2+\rho^2 d\theta^2+\rho^2 \sin^2\theta d\phi^2$
    describes the vacuum and the Schwarzschild solution describes the
    gravitational field near a **massive body**. Intuitively, the metric
    tensor $g$ is determined by $g(v,v)$, and the Ricci tensor by $R(v,v)$
    which is 3 times the average sectional curvature over all planes passing
    through a plane through $v$. The scalar curvature is 6 times the average
    over all sectional curvatures passing through a point. See

    Let $X$ be a finite set and $\mathcal{A}$ be a family of finite subset
    $A$ of $X$. A **transversal** of $\mathcal{A}$ is an injective function
    $f: \mathcal{A} \to X$ such that $f(A) \in A$ for all
    $A \in \mathcal{A}$. The set $\mathcal{A}$ satisfies the **marriage
    condition** if for every finite subset $\mathcal{B}$ of $\mathcal{A}$,
    one has $|\mathcal{B}| \leq |\bigcup_{A \in \mathcal{B}} A|$. The **Hall
    marriage theorem** is
    
    > $\mathcal{A}$ has a transversal $\Leftrightarrow$ $\mathcal{A}$
    satisfies marriage condition.
    
    The theorem was proven by Philip Hall in 1935. It implies for example
    that if a deck of cards with 52 cards is partitioned into 13 equal sized
    piles, one can chose from each deck a card so that the 13 cards have
    exactly one card of each rank. The theorem can be deduced from a result
    in graph geometry: if $G=(V,E)=(X,\emptyset)+(Y,\emptyset)$ is a
    bipartite graph, then a **matching** in $G$ is a collection of edges
    which pairwise have no common vertex. For a subset $W$ of $X$, let
    $S(W)$ denote the set of all vertices adjacent to some element in $W$.
    The theorem assures that there is an **X-saturating matching** (a
    matching covering $X$) if and only if $|W| \leq |S(W)|$ for every
    $W \subset X$. The reason for the name \"marriage\" is the situation that
    $X$ is a set of men and $Y$ a set of women and that all men are eager to
    marry. Let $A_i$ be the set of women which could make a spouse for the
    $i$'th man, then marrying everybody off is an $X$-saturating matching.
    The condition is that any set of $k$ men has a combined list of at least
    $k$ women who would make suitable spouses. See [@Brualdi2004].

    construction can be done in higher dimensions too: The **Mandelbulb

    for which $T(x)=x^8+c$ leads to a bounded orbit starting at $0=(0,0,0)$,

    if $x$ has the **spherical coordinates** $(\rho,\phi,\theta)$. Like the
    Mandelbrot set it is a compact set. The topology of $M_8$ is unexplored.
    Also like in the complex plane, one could look at the dynamics of a
    polynomials $p=a_0 + a_1 x + \cdots + a_r x^r$ in $\mathbf{R}^n$. If
    $(\rho, \phi_1, \dots, \phi_{n-1})$ are spherical coordinates, then
    $x \to x^m = (\rho^m, m \phi_1, \dots, m \phi_{n-1})$ is a higher

    the linear space of linear functionals $f:X \to \mathbb{R}$ with the
    norm $|f| = \sup_{|x| \leq 1, x \in X} |f(x)|$. It is again a Banach
    space. The **weak\* topology** is the smallest topology on $X^*$ which
    makes all maps $f \to f(x)$ continuous for all $x \in X$.
    
    > The unit ball in a dual Banach space $X^*$ is weak\* compact.
    
    The theorem was proven in 1932 in the separable case by Stefan Banach
    and in 1940 in general by Leonidas Alaoglu. The result essentially
    follows from Tychonov's theorem as $X^*$ can be seen as a closed subset
    of a product space. Banach-Alaoglu therefore relies on the axiom of
    choice. A case which often appears in applications is when $X=C(K)$ is
    the space of continuous functions on a compact Hausdorff space $K$. In
    that case $X^*$ is the space of **signed measures** on $K$. One
    implication is that the set of **probability measures** is compact on
    $K$. An other example are $L^p$ spaces ($p \in [1,\infty)$, for which
    the dual is $L^q$ with $1/p+1/q=1$ (meaning $q=\infty$ for $p=1$) and
    showing that for $p=2$, the Hilbert space $L^2$ is self-dual. In the
    work of Bourbaki the theorem was extended from Banach spaces to
    **locally convex spaces** (linear spaces equipped with a family of
    semi-norms). Examples are **Fréchet spaces**, (locally convex spaces
    which are complete with respect to a translation-invariant metric). See

    A graph $G=(V,E)$ with vertex set $V$ and edge set $E$ is called
    **planar** if it can be embedded in the Euclidean plane $\mathbb{R}^2$
    without any of the edges intersecting. By a theorem of Kuratowski, this
    is equivalent to a graph theoretical statement: $G$ does not contain a
    homeomorphic image of neither the complete graph $K_5$ nor the bipartite
    utility graph $K_{3,3}$. A **graph coloring** with $k$ colors is a
    function $f: V \to \{1,2, \dots, k\}$ with the property that if
    $(x,y) \in E$, then $f(x) \neq f(y)$. In other words, adjacent vertices
    must have different colors. The **4-color theorem** is:
    
    > Every planar graph can be colored with $4$ colors.
    
    Some graphs need 4 colors like a wheel graph having an odd number of
    spikes. There are planar graphs which need less. The 1-point graph $K_1$
    needs only one color, trees needs only 2 colors and the graph $K_3$ or
    any wheel graph with an even number of spikes only need 3 colors. The
    theorem has an interesting history: since August Ferdinand Möbius in
    1840 spread a precursor problem given to him by Benjamin Gotthold
    Weiske, the problem was first known also as the **Möbius-Weiske puzzle**
    [@Soifer]. The actual problem was first posed in 1852 by Francis Guthrie
    [@MaritzMouton], after thinking about it with his brother Frederick, who
    communicated it to his teacher Augustus de Morgan, a former teacher of
    Francis who told William Hamilton about it. Arthur Cayley in 1878 put it
    first in print, (but it was still not in the language of graph theory).
    Alfred Kempe published a proof in 1879. But a gap was noticed by Percy
    John Heawood 11 years later in 1890. There were other unsuccessful
    attempts like one by Peter Tait in 1880. After considerable theoretical
    work by various mathematicians including Charles Pierce, George
    Birkhoff, Oswald Veblen, Philip Franklin, Hassler Whitney, Hugo
    Hadwiger, Leonard Brooks, William Tutte, Yoshio Shimamoto, Heinrich
    Heesch, Karl Dürre or Walter Stromquist, a computer assisted proof of
    the 4-color theorem was obtained by Ken Appel and Wolfgang Haken in
    1976. In 1997, Neil Robertson, Daniel Sanders, Paul Seymour, and Robin
    Thomas wrote a new computer program. Goerge Gonthier produced in 2004 a
    fully machine-checked proof of the four-color theorem [@RobinWilson].

    Assume $M$ is a smooth compact orientable $(2n-1)$-manifold equipped
    with an auxiliary Riemannian metric $g$. A **$1$-form**
    $\alpha \in \Lambda^1(M)$ defines a **field of hyperplanes**
    $\xi = {\rm ker}(\alpha) \subset TM$. Conversely, given a field of
    hyperplanes, one can define $\alpha = g(X,\cdot)$, where $X$ is a local
    non-zero section of the line bundle $\xi^{\perp}$. A **contact
    structure** is a hyperplane field $\xi=d\alpha$ for which the volume
    form $\alpha \wedge (d\alpha)^n$ is nowhere zero. The 1-form $\alpha$ is
    then called a **contact form** and $(M,\xi)$ is called a **contact
    manifold**. The **Reeb vector field** $R$ is defined by
    $d\alpha(R,\cdot)=0$, $\alpha(R)=1$. The **Weinstein conjecture** is a
    theorem in dimension 3:
    
    > On a 3-manifold, the Reeb vector field has a closed periodic orbit.
    
    The theorem was proven by Clifford Taubes in 2007 using Seiberg-Witten
    theory. Mike Hutchings with Taubes established 2 Reeb orbits under the
    condition that all Reeb orbits $R$ are **non-degenerate** in the sense
    that the linearized flow does not have an eigenvalue $1$. Hutchings with
    Dan Cristofaro-Gardiner later removed the non-degeneracy condition
    [@HutchingsTaubes; @CristofaroHutshings] and also showed that if the
    product of the **actions** $\mathcal{A}(\gamma) = \int_\gamma \alpha$ of
    the two orbits is larger than the **volume**
    $\int_M \alpha \wedge d\alpha$ of the contact form, then there are
    three. To the history: Alan Weinstein has shown already that if $Y$ is a
    convex compact hypersurface in $\mathbb{R}^{2n}$, then there is a
    periodic orbit. Paul Rabinovitz extended it to star-shaped surfaces.
    Weinstein conjectured in 1978 that every compact hypersurface of contact
    type in a symplectic manifold has a closed characteristic. Contact
    geometry as an odd dimensional brother of symplectic geometry has become
    its own field. Contact structures are the opposite of integrable
    hyperplane fields: the **Frobenius integrability** condition
    $\alpha \wedge d\alpha=0$ defines an **integrable hyperplane field**
    forming a co-dimension $1$ foliation of $M$. Contact geometry is
    therefore a \"totally non-integrable hyper plane field\".
    [@GeigesContact]. The higher dimensional case of the Weinstein
    conjecture is wide open [@HutchingsReview]. Also the symplectic question
    whether every compact and regular energy surface $H=c$ for a Hamiltonian
    vector field in $\mathbb{R}^{2n}$ has a periodic solution is open. One
    knows that there are for almost all energy values in a small interval

    A **convex polytope** $G$ is defined as the convex hull of $n$ points in
    $\mathbb{R}^{d}$ such that all vertices are **extreme points** called
    **vertices**. (Extreme points are points which do not lie in an open
    line segment of $G$.) This definition of [@gruenbaum] is also called a
    **polytopal sphere**. A **simplicial sphere** is a geometric realization
    of a simplicial complex that is homeomorphic to the standard
    (d-1)-dimensional spheres in $\mathbb{R}^{d}$. For a polytopal sphere,
    the boundary of $G$ is made up of $(d-1)$-dimensional polytopes called
    **$(d-1)$-faces**. A **cyclic polytope** $C(n,d)$ can be realized as the
    convex hull of the $n$ vertices
    $\{ (t,t^2,t^3, \cdots t^d) \; | \; t =1,2, \dots, n\} \subset \mathbb{R}^{d}$.
    Let $f_k(G)$ denote the number of $k$-dimensional faces in $G$. So,
    $f_0(G)$ is the number of vertices, $f_1(G)$ the number of line segments
    and $f_{d-1}$ the number of facets, the highest dimensional faces in
    $G$. Extending the definition to $f_{-1}=1$ (counting the empty complex,
    which is a $(-1)$-dimensional complex), the vector
    $f=(f_{-1},f_0,f_1, \cdots f_{d})$ is called the **extended $f$-vector**
    of $G$. The **upper bound theorem** is
    
    > For simplicial spheres with $f_0(G)=n$, then
    $f_k(G) \leq f_k(C(n,d))$.
    
    This had been the **upper bound conjecture** of Theodore Motzkin from
    1957 which was proven by Peter McMullen in 1970 who reformulated it
    $h_k(G) \leq {n-d+k-1 \choose k}$ for all $k < d/2$ as the other numbers
    are determined by **Dehn-Sommerville conditions** $h_k=h_{d-k}$ for
    $0 \leq k \leq d$. The **$h$-vector** $(h_0, \dots h_{d})$ and
    **$f$-vector** $(f_{-1},f_0, \dots, f_{d-1})$ determine each other via
    $\sum_{k=0}^d f_{k-1}(t-1)^{d-k}=\sum_{k=0}^d h_k t^{d-k}$. Victor Klee
    suggested the upper bound conjecture to be true for simplicial spheres,
    which was then proven in by Richard Stanley in 1975 using new ideas like
    relating $h_k$ with intersection cohomology of a projective **toric
    variety** associated with the dual of $G$. (A **toric variety** is an
    algebraic variety containing an algebraic torus as an open dense subset
    such that the group action on the torus extends to the variety.) The
    result for **simplicial spheres** implies the result for convex
    polytopes because a subdivision of faces of a convex polytope into
    simplices only increases the numbers $f_k$. The **g-conjecture** of
    McMullen from 1971 gives a complete characterization of $f$-vectors of
    simplicial spheres. Define $g_0=1$ and $g_k=h_k-h_{k-1}$ for
    $k \leq d/2$. The $g$-conjecture claims that $(g_0, \dots g_{[d/2]})$
    appears as a g-vector of a sphere triangulation if and only if there
    exists a multicomplex $\Gamma$ with exactly $g_k$ vectors of degree $k$
    for all $0 \leq i \leq [d/2]$. (A **multi-complex** $\Gamma$ is a set of
    non-negative integer vectors $(a_1, \dots, a_n)$ such that if
    $0 \leq b_i \leq a_i$, then $(b_1, \dots b_n)$ is in $\Gamma$. The
    degree of a multicomplex is $\sum_i a_i$.) The **g-theorem** proves this
    for polytopal spheres (Billera and Lee in 1980 sufficiency) and (Stanley
    1980 giving necessity). The g-conjecture is open for simplicial spheres.

    As the theorem was conjectured in 1845 by Joseph Bertrand, it is still

    (Chebyshev) proof in 1852, it is a theorem. For a proof, see
    [@NivenZuckermanMontgomery] page 367. Srinivasa Ramanujan simplified
    Chebyshev's proof considerably in 1919 and strengthened it: if
    $\pi(x) = \sum_{p \leq x, p \; {\rm prime}} 1$ is the prime counting
    function, then Bertrand's result can be restated as
    $\pi(x)-\pi(x/2) \geq 1$ for $x \geq 2$. Ramanujna shows that
    $\pi(x)-\pi(x/2) \geq k$, for large enough $x$ (larger or equal than
    $p_k$). The primes $p_k$ giving the lower bound for $x$ solving this are
    called **Ramanujan primes**. Simple proofs like one of Erdös from 1932
    are given in Wikipedia or [@Hua1982] page 82, who notes \"it is not a
    very sharp result. Deep analytic methods can be used to give much better
    results concerning the gaps between successive primes\". There is a very
    simple proof assuming the **Goldbach conjecture** (stating that every
    even number larger than $2$ is a sum of two primes): [@RicardoGoldbach]
    if $n$ is not prime, then $2n=p+q$ is a sum of two primes, where one is
    larger than $n$ and one smaller than $2n$; on the other hand, if $n$ is
    prime, then $n+1$ is not prime and $2n+2=p+q$ is a sum of two primes,
    where one, say $q$ is larger than $n$ and smaller than $2n+2$. But $q$
    can not be $2n+1$ (as that would mean $p=1$), nor $2n$ (as $2n$ is
    composite) so that $n<q<2n$. There are various generalizations like
    Mohamed El Bachraoui's 2006 theorem that there are primes between $2n$
    and $3n$ or Denis Hanson from 1973 [@Hanson1973] that there are primes
    between $3n$ and $4n$ for $n \geq 1$. Mohamed El Bachraoui asked in 2006
    whether for all $n>1$ and all $k \leq n$, there exists a prime in
    $[kn,(k+1)n]$ which is for $k=1$ the Bertrand postulate. A positive
    answer would give that there is always a prime in the interval
    $[n^2,n^2+n]$. Already the **Legendre conjecture**, asking whether there
    is always a prime $p$ satisfying $n^2<p<(n+1)^2$ for $n \geq 1$ is open.
    The **Legendre's conjecture** is the fourth of the super famous great
    problems of Edmund Landau's 1912 list: the other three are the
    **Goldbach conjecture**, the **twin prime conjecture** and then the
    **Landau conjecture** asking whether there are infinitely many primes of
    the form $n^2+1$. Landau really nailed it. There are 4 conjectures only,
    but all of them can be stated in half a dozen words, are completely
    elementary, and for more than 100 years, nobody has proven nor disproved
    any of them.

    Gosson allegory [@GossonCamel] after encoding \"camel\" = \"ball in the
    phase space\", \"hole = \"cylinder\", and \"pass\"=\"symplectically embed
    into\", \"size of the hole\" = \"radius of cylinder\" and \"size of the
    camel\" = \"radius of the ball\" is: \"There is no way that a camel can
    pass through a hole if the size of the hole is smaller than the size of
    the camel\". See [@McDuff2009; @HutchingsFun2016] for expositions. The
    non-squeezing theorem motivated also the introduction of **symplectic
    capacities**, quantities which are monotone $c(M) \leq c(N)$ if there is
    a symplectic embedding of $M$ into $N$, which are conformal in the sense
    that if $\omega$ is scaled by $\lambda$, then $c(M)$ is scaled by
    $|\lambda|$ and such that $c(B(1)) = c(Z(1))=\pi$. For $n=1$, the area
    is an example of a symplectic capacity (actually unique). The existence
    of a symplectic capacity obviously proves the squeezing theorem. Already
    Gromov introduced an example, the **Gromov width**, which is the
    smallest. More are constructed in using calculus of variations. See

  area : Kähler Geometry
  satz : The Calabi inverse problem has a unique solution $\omega$.
  long : |
    A **Kähler manifold** is a complex manifold $(M,J)$ together with a
    Hermitian metric $h$ whose associated **Kähler form** $\omega$ is
    closed. (The manifold can be given by a Riemannian metric $g$
    **compatible** with the complex structure $g(JX,JY) = g(X,Y)$. The
    **Kähler form** $\omega$ is then a 2-form $\omega(X,Y)=g(JX,Y)$
    satisfying $d\omega=0$ and $h=g+i\omega$ is the Hermitian metric.
    $(M,\omega)$ is then also a symplectic manifold.) As $\omega$ is closed,
    it represents an element in the cohomology class $H^2(M)$ called
    **Kähler class**. The **Calabi inverse problem** is: given a compact
    Kähler manifold $(M,\omega_0)$ and a $(1,1)$-form $R$ representing
    $2\pi$ times the **first Chern class** of $M$, find a metric $\omega$ in
    the Kähler class of $\omega_0$ such that ${\rm Ricci}(\omega)= R$. In
    local coordinates, one can write
    ${\rm Ricci}(\omega) = -i \partial \overline{\partial} \log {\rm det}(g)$.
    For compact $M$:
    
    > The Calabi inverse problem has a unique solution $\omega$.
    
    This was conjectured in 1957 by Eugenio Calabi and proven in 1978 by
    Shing-Tung Yau by solving nonlinear **Monge-Ampère** equations using
    analytic techniques like Nash-Moser type techniques. The theorem implies
    that if the first Chern class of $M$ is zero, then $(M,\omega_0)$
    carries has a unique **Ricci-flat** Kähler metric $g$ in the same Kähler
    class than $\omega_0$. Kähler geometry deals simultaneously with
    Riemannian, symplectic and complex structures: $(M,g)$ is a Riemannian,
    $(M,\omega)$ is a symplectic and $(M,J)$ is a complex manifold. The
    inverse problem of characterizing geometries from curvature data is
    central in all of differential geometry. Here are some examples: a)
    $M=\mathbb{C}^n$ with Euclidean metric $g$ is Kähler with
    $\omega=(i/2) \sum_k dz^k \wedge d\overline{z}^k$ but it is not compact.
    But if $\Gamma$ is a lattice, then the induced metric on the torus
    $\mathbb{C}^n/\Gamma$ is Kähler. b) Because complex submanifolds of a
    Kähler manifold are Kähler , and the complex projective space
    $\mathbb{C}P^n$ with the **Fubini-Study metric** is Kähler (with
    $\omega=i \partial \overline{\partial} \rho$, where
    $\rho=\log(1+\sum_k |z_k|^2/2)$ is the **Kähler potential**), any
    **complex projective variety** is Kähler. d) For the complex hyperbolic
    case where $M$ is the unit ball in $\mathbb{C}^n$, the Kähler potential
    is $\rho=1-|z|^2$. By Kodeira, Kähler forms representing an integral
    cohomology class correspond to projective algebraic varieties. c)
    **Calabi-Yau** manifolds are complex Kähler manifolds with zero first
    Chern classes. Examples are **K3** surfaces. The existence theorem
    assures that they carry a **Ricci-flat metric**, which are examples of
    **Kähler-Einstein** metrics. Also Hodge theory works well for Kähler
    manifolds. In the complex, the **Dolbeault operators**
    $\partial, \overline{\partial}$ and $d=\partial+\overline{\partial}$
    lead to **Hodge Laplacians**
    $\Delta_\partial, \Delta_{\overline{\partial}}$ and $\Delta_d$, and so
    to **harmonic forms** $H^{p,q}$ for differential forms of type $(p,q)$
    and harmonic $r$-forms for $\Delta$. In the Kähler case,
    $H^r = \sum_{p+q=r} H^{p,q}$. An example result due to Lichnerowicz is
    that if ${\rm Ricci}(\Omega) \geq \lambda>0$, then the first eigenvalue
    $\lambda_1$ of $\Delta$ satisfies $\lambda_1 \geq 2 \lambda$. See

    The **intersection points** of this Pascal configuration is the set of

  area : Vitali theorem
  satz : There exist sets in $\mathbb{R}^n$ that are not Lebesgue measurable.
  long : |
    A **Lebesgue measure** in Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^n$ is a Borel
    measure which is invariant under Euclidean transformations. It is the
    Haar measure of the locally compact group $\mathbb{R}^n$ and unique if
    the unit cube has measure $1$. In dimension $n=1$, the Lebesgue measure
    of an interval $[a,b]$ is $b-a$. In dimension $n=2$, the Lebesgue
    measure of a measurable set is the area of the set. In particular, a
    ball of radius $r$ has area $\pi r^2$. When constructing the measure one
    has to specify a $\sigma$-algebra, which is in the Lebesgue case the
    Borel $\sigma$-algebra generated by the open sets in $\mathbb{R^n}$. One
    has for every $n \geq 1$:
    
    > There exist sets in $\mathbb{R}^n$ that are not Lebesgue
    measurable.
    
    The result is due to Giusetppe Vitali from 1905. It justifies why one
    has to go through all the trouble of building a $\sigma$-algebra
    carefully and why it is not possible to work with the $\sigma$-algebra
    of all subsets of $\mathbb{R}$ (which is called the **discrete
    $\sigma$-algebra**). The proof of the Vitali theorem shows connections
    with the foundations of mathematics: by the **axiom of choice** there
    exists a set $V$ which represents equivalence classes in
    $\mathbb{T}/\mathbb{Q}$, where $T$ is the circle. For this Vitali set
    $V$ all translates $V_r = V+r$ are all disjoint with $r \in \mathbb{Q}$.
    $\{ r+V ,  \; r \in \mathbb{Q} \} = \mathbb{R}$ is a partition. By the
    Lebesgue measure property, all translated sets $V_r$ have the same
    measure. As they are a countable set and are disjoint and add up to a
    set of Lebesgue measure $1$, they have to have measure zero. But this
    contradics $\sigma$ additivity. Now lift $V$ to $R$ and then build
    $V \times \mathbb{R}^{n-1}$. More spectacular are decompositions of the
    unit ball into $5$ disjoint sets which are equivalent under Euclidean
    transformations and which can be reassembled to get two disjoint unit
    balls. This is the **Banach-Tarski construction** from 1924.

    If $f \in L^2(\mathbb{T})$, where

    $c=(\dots, c_{-2},c_{-1},c_0,c_1,c_2, \dots) \in l^2(\mathbb{Z})$ is
    given by $c_k = (2\pi)^{-1} \int_{\mathbb{T}} f(x) e^{i k x} \; dx$. For
    smooth $f$, one knows $g=f$ and Parseval's identity
    $\int_{\mathbb{R}} f^2(x) \; dx = \sum_k c_k^2$ so that the Fourier
    transform extends to an unitary operator
    $L^2(\mathbb{T})  \to l^2(\mathbb{Z})$. This does not say anything yet
    about the convergence of the sequence $g_n(x)$. We say the Fourier
    series **converges to $f$ at a point $x$**, if the sequence
    $g_n(x) = \sum_{k=-n}^n c_k e^{i k x}$ converges to $f(x)$ for
    $n \to \infty$. We say, a sequence $g_n(x)$ converges almost everywhere
    to $f$, if there exists a set $Y \subset \mathbb{T}$ of full Lebesgue
    measure $\mu(\mathbb{T})=1$ such that the series converges for all
    $x \in Y$. (The Lebesgue measure is the normalized Haar measure
    $dx/(2\pi)$ on the circle). That the question can be subtle is
    illustrated by the result of Andrey Kolmogorov from 1923 to 1926, who
    gave examples of $L^1(\mathbb{T})$ functions for which the Fourier
    series diverges everywhere.

    difficult. While mentioned in harmonic analysis texts like [@Katznelson]

    Let $(X,\mathcal{O})$ be connected topological space and
    $f: X \to \mathbb{R}$ a continuous map. We say $f$ takes both positive
    and negative signs if there exists $a,b \in X$ such that $f(a)<0$ nd
    $f(b)>0$. A **root** of $f$ is a point $x$ such that $f(x)=0$. Let
    $C(X)$ denote the set of continuous functions from $X$ to $\mathbb{R}$,
    meaning that for $f \in C(X)$ and all open sets $U$ in $\mathbb{R}$, one
    has $f^{-1}(U) \in \mathcal{O}$.
    
    > $f \in C(X)$ reaching both signs on a connected $X$ has a root.
    
    The theorem was proven by Bernard Bolzano in 1817 for functions from
    $[a,b]$ to $\mathbb{R}$. The proof follows from the definitions: as
    $P=(0,\infty)$ is open, also $f^{-1}(P)$ is open. As $N=(-\infty,0)$ is
    open, also $f^{-1}(N)$ is open. If there is no root, then $X=N \cup P$
    is a disjoint union of two open sets and so disconnected contradicting
    the assumption of $X$ being connected. A consequences is the **wobbly
    table theorem**: given a square table with parallel equal length legs
    and a \"floor\" given by the graph $z=g(x,y)$ of a continuous $g$ can be
    rotated and possibly translated in the $z$ direction so that all 4 legs
    are on the table. The proof of this application is seen as a consequence
    of the intermediate value theorem applied to the height function
    $f(\phi)$ of the fourth leg if three other legs are on the floor. A
    consequence is also **Rolle's theorem** assuring that if a continuously
    differentiable function $[a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ with $f(a)=f(b)$ has a
    point $x \in (a,b)$ with $f'(x)=0$. Tilting Rolle gives the **mean value
    theorem** assuring that for a continuously differentiable function
    $[a,b] \to \mathbb{R}$ there exists $x \in (a,b)$ with
    $f'(x)=f(b)-f(a)$. The general theorem shows that it is the
    connectedness and not completeness which is the important assumption.

    It has been proven by Oskar Perron in 1907 and by Georg Frobenius in
    1912. When seeing the map $x \to Ax$ on the projective space, this is in
    suitable coordinates a contraction and the Banach fixed point theorem
    applies. The Brouwer fixed point theorem only gives existence, not
    uniqueness, but the Brouwer fixed point applies for non-negative
    matrices. This has applications in graph theory, Markov chains or Google
    page rank. The Google matrix is defined as $G=d A + (1-d)E$, where $d$
    is a **damping factor** and $A$ is a Markov matrix defined by the
    network and $E$ is the matrix $E_{ij}=1$. Sergey Brin and Larry Page
    write \"the damping factor $d$ is the probability at each page the random

    Given a path connected pointed topological space $X$ with base $b$, the
    $n$'th **homotopy group** $\pi_n(X)$ is the set of equivalence classes
    of base preserving maps from the pointed sphere $S^n$ to $X$. It can be
    written as the set of homotopy classes of maps from the **$n$-cube**
    $[0,1]^n$ to $X$ such that the boundary of $[0,1]^n$ is mapped to $b$.
    It becomes a group by defining addition as
    $(f+g)(t_1,\dots, t_n)=f(2t_1,t_2, \dots t_n)$ for $0 \leq t_1 \leq 1/2$
    and $(f+g)(t_1,\dots, t_n) = g(2t_1-1,t_2, \dots ,t_n)$ for
    $1/2 \leq t \leq 1$. In the case $n=1$, this is \"joining the trip\":
    travel first along the first curve with twice the speed, then take the
    second curve. The groups $\pi_n$ do not depend on the base point. As $X$
    is assumed to be connected, $\pi_0(X)$ is the trivial group. The group
    $\pi_1(X)$ is the **fundamental group**. It can be non-abelian. For
    $n \geq 2$, the groups $\pi_n(X)$ are always abelian $f+g = g+f$. The
    $k$'th **homology group** $H_n(X)$ of a topological space $X$ with
    integer coefficients is obtained from the chain complex of the free
    abelian group generated by continuous maps from $n$-dimensional
    simplices to $X$. The **Hurewicz theorem** is
    
    > There exists a homomorphism $\pi_n(X) \to H_n(X)$.
    
    Higher homotopy groups were discovered by Witold Hurewitz from
    1935-1936. The Hurewitz theorem is due to Hurewicz from 1950
    [@Hurewicz]. In the case $n=1$ the homomorphism can be easily described:
    if $\gamma: [0,1] \to X$ is a path, then since $[0,1]$ is a $1$-simplex,
    the path is a singular $1$-simplex in $X$. As the boundary of $\gamma$
    is empty, this singular $1$-simplex is a cycle. This allows to see it as
    an element in $H_1(X)$. If two paths are homotopic, then their
    corresponding singular simplices are equivalent in $H_1(X)$. There is an
    elegant proof using Hodge theory if $X=M$ is a compact manifold: the
    image $C$ of a map $\pi_p(M)$ can be interpreted as a Schwartz
    distribution on $M$. Let $L=(d+d^*)^2$ be the Hodge Laplacian and let
    the heat flow $e^{-t L}$ act on $C$. For $t>0$, the image $e^{-t L} C$
    is now smooth and defines a differential form in $\Lambda^p(M)$. As all
    the non-zero eigenspaces get damped exponentially, the limit of the heat
    flow is a **harmonic form**, an eigenvector to the eigenvalue $0$. But
    Hodge theory identifies ${\rm ker}(L|\Lambda^p)$ with $H^p(M)$ and so
    with $H_p(M)$ by Poincaré duality. The Hurewitz homomorphism is then
    even constructive. \"Just heat up the curve to get the corresponding
    cohomology element, the commutator group elements get melted away by the
    heat.\" A space $X$ is called **$n$-connected** if $\pi_i(X)=0$ for all
    $i \leq n$. So, $0$-connected means **path connected** and $1$-connected
    is **simply connected**. For $n \geq 2$, one has $\pi_n(X)$ isomorphic
    to $H_n(X)$ if $X$ is $(n-1)$-connected. In the case $n=1$, this can
    already not be true as $\pi_1(X)$ is in general non-commutative and
    $H_1(X)$ is but $H_1(X)$ is the isomorphic to the **abelianization** of
    $G=\pi_1(X)$ which is the group obtained by factoring out the commutator
    subgroup $[G,G]$ which is a normal subgroup of $G$ and generated by all

    **energy** $E(r)=m r'^2/2+V(r)$ and **angular momentum**
    $L=m r \wedge r'$, a $n(n+1)/2$ dimensional quantity. The invariance of
    $L$ assures that $r(t)$ stays in the plane initially spanned by $r(0)$
    and $r'(0)$ and that the area of the parallelogram spanned by $r(t)$ and
    $r'(t)$ is constant. To see the natural potential in $\mathbb{R}^n$ is,
    one has to go beyond Newton and pass to Gauss, who wrote the
    gravitational law in the form ${\rm div}(F) = 4 \pi \rho$, where $\rho$
    is the mass density. It expresses that mass is the source for the force
    field $F$. To get the force field in a central symmetric mass
    distribution, one can use the **divergence theorem** in $\mathbb{R}^n$
    and relate the integral of $4 \pi \rho$ over a ball of radius $r$ with
    the flux of $F$ through the sphere $S(r)$ of radius $r$. The former is
    $4 \pi M$, where $M$ is the total mass in the ball, the later is
    $-|S(r)| F(r)$, where $|S(r)|$ is the surface area of the sphere and the
    negative sign is because for an attractive force $F(r)$ points inside.
    So, in three dimensions, Gauss recovers the Newton gravitational law
    $F(r)=-4\pi G M/|S(r)| = -G M/|r|^2$. There is a natural central force
    **Kepler problem** in any dimensions: in $\mathbb{R}^n$, we have
    $F(r)=-C_n r/|r|^n$ where $C_n$ is a constant. For $n=1$, there is a
    constant force pulling the particle towards the center, for $n=2$, one
    has a $1/|r|$ force which corresponds to a logarithmic potential, for
    $n=3$, it is the Newtonian inverse square $1/r^2$ force, in $n=4$, it is
    a $1/r^3$ force. For $n=0$, one formally gets the **harmonic
    oscillator** which is **Hook's law**. Which potentials lead to periodic
    motion? The answer is surprising and was given by Bertrand: only the
    harmonic oscillator potential and the Newtonian potential in
    $\mathbb{R}^3$ work. Let us call a central force potential **all
    periodic** if every bounded (position and velocity) solution $r(t)$ of
    the differential equations is periodic. Already for the Kepler problem,
    there are not only motions on ellipses but also scattering solutions
    moving on parabola or hyperbola, or then suicide motions, with
    $r'(0)=0$, where the particle dives into the singularity.
    
    > Only the Newton potentials for $n=-1$ and $n=3$ are all periodic.
    
    This theorem of Joseph Bertrand from 1873 tells that three dimensional
    space is special as it in any other dimension, calendars would be almost
    periodic. We could live with that but there are more compelling reasons
    why $n=3$ is dynamically better: in other dimensions, only very special
    orbits stay bounded. A small perturbation leads to the planet colliding
    with the sun or escaping to infinity, both not very pleasant for
    possible inhabitants. Gauss's analysis also shows in any dimension $n$,
    the motion of a particle in a constant mass density is always given by
    the **harmonic oscillator motion**, independent of the dimension: the
    divergence theorem gives $4\pi \rho |B(r)| = -|S(r)| F(r)$, where
    $|B(r)|$ is the volume of the solid ball of radius $r$. This gives the
    Hook law force $F(x)=-4\pi \rho x/(n)$, where $n$ is the dimension.

  area : Catastrophe theory
  satz : For a residual set in $X$, $M_f$ is an $r$-dimensional manifold.
  long : |
    Catastrophe theory describes the singularity structure of smooth
    functions $f$ on a $n$-manifold $M$ parametrized by some $r$ parameters.
    A basic assumption is that **configurations of interest** of the
    functional $f$ are **critical points** of $f:M \to R$. Especially
    interesting are minima, stable configurations. When changing parameters
    of $f$, **bifurcations**, structural changes of the critical set can
    happen. Especially, minima can change their nature or disappear. In
    particular, the function $f_t(x_t))$, where $x_t$ is a local minimum can
    change discontinuously, even if the function $(t,x) \to f_t(x)$ is
    smooth. Such discontinuous changes are called **catastrophes**. The
    stage for Thom's theorem is a smooth function
    $f: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^r$. One can think of $f$ as a $r$
    parameter family of functions on **space** $\mathbb{R}^n$. Let
    $\nabla_x= (\partial_{x_1}, \dots \partial_{x_n})$ is the **gradient
    operator** with respect to the space variables and
    $M_f = \{ (x,y) \in \mathbb{R}^n \times \mathbb{R}^r \; | \; \nabla_x f=0 \}$
    is the submanifold on which points are critical. The space
    $X=C^{\infty}(\mathbb{R}^n \times \mathbb{R}^r)$ of smooth functions in
    space and parameter can be equipped with the **Whitney topology**, the
    topology generated by a basis which is the union of all the basis sets
    of $C^k$ Whitney topologies. A basis for the later is the set of all
    functions for which $f^{(j)}(x,y) \in U_j$ for all $0 \leq j \leq k$ and
    $U_0, \cdots U_k$ are all open intervals. With the Whitney $C^{\infty}$
    topology, $X$ is a Baire space so that **residual sets** (countable
    intersections of open dense sets), are dense. The next theorem works
    $n=2, r \leq 6$ and for $n \geq 3$ if $r \leq 5$ [@Michor]
    
    > For a residual set in $X$, $M_f$ is an $r$-dimensional manifold.
    
    The theorem was due to René Thom who initiated Catastrophe theory in a
    1966 article and wrote [@ThomMorphogenesis] building on previous work by
    Hassler Whitney. More work and proofs were done by various
    mathematicians like John Mather or Bernard Malgrange. There is more to
    it: the restriction $X_f$ of the projection of the singularity set $M_f$
    onto the parameter space $\mathbb{R}^r$ can be classified. Thom proved
    that that for $r=4$, there are exactly **seven elementary
    catastrophes**: \"fold\", \"cusp\", \"swallowtail\", \"butterfly\",
    \"hyperbolic umbillic\", \"elliptic umbillic\" and \"parabolic umbillic\".
    For $r=5$, the number of catastrophe types is $11$. The subject is part
    of **singularity theory** of differentiable maps, a theory that started
    by Hassler Whitney in 1955. The theory of **bifurcations** was developed
    by Henri Poincare and Alexander Andronov. See also
    [@Michor; @StewartCatastrophe; @ArnoldCatastrophe]. It is also widely
    studied in the context of dynamical systems [@Misbah].

  long : |
    Given a finite simple graph $G=(V,E)$, an **interaction function**
    $J: E \to \mathbb{R}$ and a scalar field $h: V \to \mathbb{R}$ defines a
    **Hamiltonian** $H(\sigma) = \sum_{(i,j) \in E} J_{ij} \sigma_i \sigma_j
    - \mu \sum_{j \in V} h_j \sigma_j$ on the set of all functions
    $\sigma: V \to \{ -1,1\}$. The interpretation is that $\sigma_i$ are
    **spin values**, $h_j$ an **external magnetic field** and $J_{ij}$ is an
    **interaction function**. The additional parameter $\mu$ is a **magnetic
    moment**. The energy $H$ defines a probability measure $P$ on the set
    $\Omega=\{-1,1\}^V$ of all spin configurations. It is the Gibbs-Bolzmann
    distribution $P[ \{ \sigma \} ] = e^{-H(\sigma)}/Z$, where $Z$ is is the
    normalization constant rendering $P$ a probability measure. One calls
    $Z$ the **partition function** (as it is usually considered to be a
    function of some of the parameters like temperature). Given a random
    variable =observable $X: \Omega \to \mathbb{R}$, one is interested in
    the expectation $E[X]$. An example is $X(\sigma) = \sigma_i \sigma_j$,
    which leads to the correlation. When replacing $H$ with $\beta H$, where
    $\beta=1/(K T)$ is an inverse temperature parameter ($T$ is the
    **temperature** and $K$ the **Bolzmann constant**), one can study the
    expectation of a random variable $X$ in dependence of $\beta$. One
    writes now also ${\rm E}[X] = \langle X \rangle_\beta$ to stress the
    dependence on $\beta$. In the case when $G$ is a $d$-dimensional lattice
    $G=[-L,L]^d$, where two lattice points $x,y$ are connected if
    $\sum_k |x_k-y_k|=1$ one look at the $L \to \infty$ limit where
    $G=\mathbb{Z}^d$. In the case $J=1,h=0$ this is the **Ising model**. As
    $J$ is positive, this is a **Ferromagnetic situation**. A parameter
    value, where a quantity like $Z_{\beta}$ or a derivative of it changes
    discontinuously is called a **phase transition**.
    
    > The Ising model in two dimensions has a phase transition.
    
    This was first proven by Lars Onsager in 1944, who in a tour de force
    gave analytical solutions. The analysis shows that there is a phase
    transition. The temperature $T$ at which this happens is called the
    **Curie temperature**. The one dimensional case had been solved by Ernst
    Ising in 1925, who got it as a PhD project from his adviser Wilhelm
    Lenz. In one dimensions, there is no phase transition. In three and
    higher dimensions, there are no analytical solutions. The Ising model is
    only one of many models and generalizations. If the $J_{ij}$ are random
    one deals with **disordered systems**. An example is the
    **Edwards-Anderson** model, where $J_{ij}$ are Gaussian random
    variables. This is an example of a **spin glass model**. An other
    example is the **Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model** from 1975, where the
    lattice is replaced by a complete graph and the $J_{ij}$ define a
    **random matrix**. An other possibility is to change the spin to $Z_n$
    or the symmetric group (Potts) or then some other Lie group (Lattice
    gauge fields) and then use a character to get a numerical value. Or one
    replaces the zero dimensional sphere with a higher dimensional sphere
    like $S^2$ and takes $\sigma_i \cdot \sigma_j$ (Heisenberg model). See

    $APB$ is called the **inscribed angle** of the secant $AB$. The next

    The theorem is believed to be known already to Thales of Miletus who is
    the first Greek mathematician known by name (624 - 546 BC). It it is
    usually called Thales theorem in the special case is if $A,B$ are on a
    diagonal. Then the angle $APB$ is a right angle. A consequence of the
    theorem is that the opposite angles of a quadrilateral which is
    inscribed in a circle add up to $\pi$. Unlike the special case of the
    right angle which immediately follows from symmetry, the full version of
    Thales theorem can surprise at first.

    This is the theorem of Fary-Milnor, proven by Fary in 1949 and Milnor in
    1950. The theorem follows also from the existence of **quadrisecants**,
    which are lines intersecting the knot in 4 points [@Denne2004]. The
    existence of quadrisecants was proven by Erika Pannwitz in 1933 for

    Morley's theorem was discovered in 1899 by Frank Morley. A short proof

    angles $3\alpha,3\beta,3\gamma$ so that $\alpha+\beta+\gamma=\pi/3$.
    Start with an equilateral triangle $PQR$ of length $1$. Build three

    Uniform continuity is a stronger version of continuity. But unlike
    continuity, which is defined for maps between topological spaces,
    uniform continuity needs more structure like metric spaces or more
    generally topological spaces with a **uniform structure**. Given two
    metric spaces $X$ and $Y$, a function $f:X \to Y$ is called
    **continuous** if $f^{-1}(U)$ is open for every open $U$ in $Y$. A
    function $f$ is called **uniformly continuous** if there exists a
    sequence of numbers $M_n \to 0$ such that for every $n$, the condition
    $d(x,y) \leq 1/n$ implies that $d(f(x),f(y)) \leq M_n$.
    
    > For compact $X$, continuous implies uniformly continuous.
    
    The theorem is due to Eduard Heine and Georg Cantor. Heine is known also
    for the Heine-Borel theorem which states that in Euclidean spaces, the
    class of closed and bounded sets agrees with the class of compact sets.
    The proof of the Heine-Cantor theorem uses the **extreme value theorem**
    assuring that a continuous function on a compact space $X$ achieves a
    maximum. Look for every $n$ and every $x$ at the minimal $M_n(x)$ such
    that if $|x-y| \leq 1/n$, then $|f(x)-f(y)| \leq M_n(x)$. Now $M_n(x)$
    is non-negative and finite and depends continuously on $x$. By the
    extremal value theorem there is a maximum. We call it $M_n$. This
    assures now that if $|x-y| \leq 1/n$, then $|f(x)-f(y)| \leq M_n$. The
    **Bolzano-Weierstrass** or sequential compactness theorem assures that a
    bounded sequence in $\mathbb{R}^n$ has a convergent subsequence. This is
    used in the intermediate value theorem assuring that if $f(a)<0$ and
    $f(b)>0$, then there is an $x$ with $f(x)=0$. The Heine-Cantor theorem
    together with the intermediate value theorem assures that continuous
    functions are Riemann integrable. The additional **uniform structure**
    or **metric structure** is also necessary when defining completeness in
    the sense that every Cauchy sequence converges. Completeness is not a
    property of topological spaces: $(0,1)$ is not complete but $\mathbb{R}$
    is complete even so the two spaces are homeomorphic.

    $J = \left[ \begin{array}{ccc} 3 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 3 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & 3 \end{array} \right]$.
    In other words, $A$ is of the form $A= \lambda 1 + N$, where $N$ is
    nilpotent: $N^m=0$ and more precisely only has $1$ in the super diagonal
    above the diagonal.
    
    > Every $n \times n$ matrix is similar to a matrix in Jordan normal
    form.
    
    Up to the order of the Jordan blocks, the Jordan normal form is unique.
    If each Jordan block is a $1 \times 1$ matrix, then the matrix is called
    **diagonalizable**. The **spectral theorem** assures that a normal
    matrix $A A^* = A^* A$ is diagonalizable. Not every matrix is
    diagonalizable as the **shear matrix**
    $A=\left[ \begin{array}{cc} 1 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 \end{array} \right]$, a
    $2 \times 2$ Jordan block, shows. The theorem has been stated first by
    Camille Jordan in 1870. For history, see [@Brechenmacher]. The
    **Jordan-Chevalley** generalization states that over an arbitrary
    perfect field, a matrix is similar to $B+N$, where $B$ is
    **semi-simple** and $N$ is **nilpotent** and $BN=NB$. (See [@Humphreys]
    page 17). A matrix $B$ is called **semi-simple** if every $B$-invariant
    linear subspace $V$ has a complementary $B$-invariant subspace. For
    algebraically closed fields, semi-simple is equivalent to be conjugated
    to a diagonal matrix. To the condition on the field: a field $k$ is
    called **perfect** if every irreducible polynomial over $k$ has distinct
    roots.

    The proof directly follows from Pythagoras just by relating the areas of

    bound by circles, while the triangle is bound by line segments. The

    constant function, every point is a local maximum. The local maximum
    also does not have to be a **global maximum**. The function
    $f(x) = x^4-x^2$ has a local maximum at $x=0$ but this is not a global
    maximum because $f(2)>f(0)$.

    $\delta S = L_x(x(t),x'(t)) - \frac{d}{dt} L_{x'}(x(t),x'(t)) = 0$. This
    so called **Hamilton principle** can be seen as a generalization of the
    Fermat principle to infinite dimensions. The equations $\delta S=0$ are
    called the **Euler-Lagrange equations** or **Lagrange equations of the
    second kind**. They are the starting point of **Lagrangian mechanics.**
    Fermat's original paper deals with the single variable situation but the
    higher dimensional situation is similar. Fermat in some sense already

    arc length of a path in a medium with two different properties like

  long : |
    A finite set $P$ of points in $\mathbb{R}^d$ is called **$r$-convex**,
    if there is a partition of $P$ into $r$ sets such that their convex
    hulls intersect simultaneously in a non-empty set. Tverberg's theorem
    states:
    
    > A set of $(r-1)(d+1)+1$ points in $\mathbb{R}^d$ is $r$-convex.
    
    The decomposition of $P$ into $r$ subsets is called the **Tverberg
    partition**. In the one-dimensional case $d=1$, the theorem assures that
    $2r-1$ points on the line are $r$-convex. For $r=3$ for example, this
    means that $5$ points are $3$-convex. If the points are arranged
    $x_1<x_2<x_3<x_4<x_5$, the Tverberg partition
    $\{ x_1,x_4\},\{x_2,x_5 \},\{x_3\}  \}$. For $r=2$, it implies **Radon's
    theorem** which tells that $d+2$ points in $\mathbb{R}^d$ can be
    partitioned into 2 sets whose convex hulls intersect. For example, $4$
    points $\{x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4\}$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$ can be partitioned into
    two sets such that their convex hull intersect. Indeed, the 4 points
    define a quadrilateral and the partition
    $\{ \{x_1,x_3\}, \{x_2,x_4\} \}$ define the two diagonals of the
    quadrilateral.
    
    The theorem has been proven by **Helge Tverberg** in 1966. See

  satz : For $r \in C^1$, the total curvature is $2\pi$.
  long : |
    Let $r$ be a continuously differentiable curve in $\mathbb{R}^2$. If
    $r(t)$ is a parametrization for which the speed is $1$, we have
    $r'(t) = (\cos(\alpha(t)),\sin(\alpha(t)))$ and a **signed curvature**
    $\kappa(t) = \alpha'(t)$. If $[0,2\pi]$ is the parameter interval, then
    $K=\int_0^{2\pi} \kappa(t) \; dt$ is the total curvature change. The
    Hopf Umlaufsatz is:
    
    > For $r \in C^1$, the total curvature is $2\pi$.
    
    The paper was proven in 1935 by Heinz Hopf [@hopf35] in a marvelous
    homotopy proof: define $f(s,t)$ as the argument of the line through
    $r(s)$ and $r(t)$ or continuously extend it $s=t$ as the argument of the
    tangent line. The direct line from $(0,0)$ to $(1,1)$ in the parameter
    $st$-plane gives a total angle change of $n 2\pi$ where $n$ is an
    integer. Now deform the curve from $(0,0)$ to $(1,1)$ so that it first
    goes straight from $(0,0)$ to $(0,1)$, then straight from $(0,1)$ to
    $(1,1)$. Both lines produce a deformation of $\pi$ and show that $n=1$.
    The theorem can be generalized to a Gauss-Bonnet theorem for planar
    regions $G$. The total curvature of the boundary is $2\pi$ times the
    Euler characteristic of $G$. For a discrete version, see [@elemente11].

  long : |
    The **Frobenius determinant theorem** tells how the determinant of the
    \"multiplication table matrix\" factors into irreducible polynomials: if
    $G = \{g_1,\dots,g_n\}$ is a finite group and $x_i$ is a variable
    associated to the group element $g_i$, then the matrix
    $A_{ij} == x_{g_i g_j}$ satisfies
    
    > ${\rm det}(A) = \prod_{j=1}^r p_j(x_1, \dots, x_n))^{d_j}$
    
    Here $d_j={\rm deg}(p_j)$ and $r$ is the number of conjugacy classes of
    $G$. For an Abelian group, there are $n$ conjugacy classes. The theorem
    had been conjectured in 1896 by Richard Dedekind. Frobenius proved it.

  satz : If $G$ is bipartite the maximal matching number is the minimal vertex
cover number.
  long : |
    A **matching** $M$ in a finite simple graph $G=(V,E)$ is a subset $M$ of
    the edges $E$ in which no two edges have a common vertex. A **vertex
    cover** $C$ is a set of vertices such that $\bigcup_{x \in C} S(x) = V$,
    where $S(x)$ is the unit sphere of a vertex $x$. A **bipartite graph**
    is a graph for which $V=V_1 \cup V_2$ can be partitioned into two
    disjoint sets $V_1,V_2$ such that all edges connect vertices from
    different sets. König's theorem, from 1931, also called König-Egeváry
    theorem is:
    
    > If $G$ is bipartite the maximal matching number is the minimal
    vertex cover number.
    
    The **vertex cover problem**, the problem to find a minimal vertex cover
    is a classical NP complete problem. For example, for a cyclic graph
    $G=C_{10}$ with $2n$ vertices $\{1,2,3, \cdots, 2n\}$ which is
    bipartite, the set $C=\{ 2,4, \cdots 2n\}$ is a minimal vertex cover.
    The edges $M=\{ (1,2), (3,4), \cdots (2n-1,2n)\}$ are a minimal
    matching. The example of an odd cyclic graph like $C_{9}$ already shows
    the bipartite condition is necessary. For $C_9$, the set $\{1,3,5,7,8\}$
    is a minimal cover and $M=\{ (1,2), (3,4), (5,6), (7,8) \}$ is a minimal
    matching.\
    The origin of the theorem is attributed to Dénes Kn̈ig, who proved it in
    1931 and wrote a precursor paper in 1916 where he prove that a regular
    (constant vertex degree) bipartite graph has a perfect matching (a
    matching which covers all vertices). For a proof see for example
    [@Diestel] (Chapter 2).
